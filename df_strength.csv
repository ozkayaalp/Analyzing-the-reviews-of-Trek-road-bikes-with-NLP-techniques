Strength:
Great value, has held up very well with 7,000 miles on it, needs little mechanical adjustments, corners well. Nice quiet 105 and Ultegra components.


Weakness:
Frame is a little too stiff for total comfort and at the same time acceleration seems a little sluggish and flexy compared to my old steel frame bike. Replaced seat straight away.


This has been a great bike for me for the money. Superb ride for the budget restrictions in place. I think this was the last year for this bike then they started cheaping out on the components. I opted to upgrade to a triple crankset and glad I did so.

Strength:
Stiff aluminum frame, available in 63 cm, is ideal for a tall (6'3"") rider. Bike was excellently fitted for the rider, by the Trek dealer, who special ordered the machine, to fit the rider.


Weakness:
A few of the original parts, such as the bontrager wheels, needed replacing/ upgrading in the first few thousand miles. Triple crank shifts a little bulky at times.


Great value. This bike is versatile and well built. The Alpha Aluminun super light race frame sticks the corners exceptionally well. I bought the bike on a budget. I couldn't then, and cannot today, pony up 3 or 4 grand for a bike. 10,000 miles, and half a dozen centuries later, from Solvang, to the Sea Otter Classic, This bike is road proven.

Stiff frame for out-of-saddle hammering. Light, and just enough performance to feel fast without being extravagant. Great bang for your buck.


Weakness:
Seat.


An awesome bike. As others have said, I also replaced the seat when I first bought it. It makes you want to go fast wherever you go. You can hammer on the pedals with no noticeable frame flexing. When I purchased it, the only other bikes that could compare were over $1200 (without pedals). Sadly I am poor and have to sell it!

Weakness:
As a mid or entry level bike this has no weaknesses.


A fantastic entry to mid level bike. As someone just getting into roadie races, this bike is more than adequate to start with. Honestly, it can either function as a good training bike or even as a racing bike. Solid group (105), frame, and accessories. To address the previous reviews, the seat just happens to be fine for me since I'm a smaller rider who doesnt need a whole lot from his saddle. Same goes for the wheels, they are plenty tough for me. They have made it through two minor crashes (one with a monster pothole and the other with a tree) and are still true. Nice to have 105 components for such a low price as well.

Strength:
Shimano 105/Ultegra setup is great. I was extremely surprised with the strength of the stock wheel set.


Weakness:
I replaced the stock saddle and tires almost right away. Although the stock saddle was beaten up by many other reviewers, I actually didn't think it was too terribly bad. I did however end up replacing it with the more comfortable Brooks.


I'm a 52 year old recreational rider who rides for fitness. I'm 6'4 and have ridden at weights all the way up to 255 at my heaviest. I was initially worried about the wheels with their low spoke counts and their ability to remain true while supporting my weight, but the Trek factory assured me the wheels could handle it. Although I don't beat the bike, I do ride long, rolling country roads that have their share of pot holes and uneven pavement. After 2 years and about 2000 road miles with alot more on the trainer, the wheels are still straight and true. I have had no cracking around spoke holes as some reviews have reported. I love this bike. The Shimano 105/Ultegra setup provides effortless, quiet, accurate shifting and the triple crank and 12/25 cassette makes hauling my well-fed self up hills relatively easy. Every morning I still look forward to riding this well designed rocket. For the money, this bike can't be beat.

I'm 46 years old. This is my first road bike after riding a cruiser bike for two years after I quit running. I couldn't be happier with the 1500. In the 1+ year I've ridden it I've turned 6,500 miles, increased my avg. speed from 14mph to almost 18mph, lost 20 lbs, and competed in 4 centuries. I've had some people tell me it's a nice starter bike until I can buy a carbon but I'm not so sure I agree. The 1500 hasn't shown a limit to it's performance. I love it.

Strength:
105 Drivechain with an Ultegra crankset.


Weakness:
Only the disposable items: saddle, pedals, tires (though the tires are suprisingly good for stock tires and particularly for Bontrager).


I looked at options for months, did bids on eBay, asked the experts and all, and my conclusion is that if you already have a mountain bike there's no use buying a cyclocross bike to go roadie on. You just don't need it. Get a road bike, and I recommend this one very highly for anyone else who wants to add to their cycling repetoire. This bike can take on the kinds of rough road conditions we have in New York City, no problem, and serves up a nice balance between agile and stable so you can tackle tough, short rides or use it to tour or century on. The carbon fork and post are enough to dampen a rough ride to a degree that's comparable with a cro-moly frame--the ultimate in comfort next to carbon. It makes me wonder why roadies are so squeemish about all but smooth, highway grade road, but maybe this bike is exceptionally stable. Really rough stuff at high speed is something to be cautious of on this bike, but for the most part you shouldn't have a problem. I also have had no problems with the bike occilating at high speed despite being ""a big guy"" which a lot of bikes of this quality are prone to do with heavy riders. I'm not a clydesdale, but I'm not 160 lbs either(note that George Hincapie is 180 lbs, so no worries if you're topping 200 or and change unless you're really up there at 275 and not planning to drop 50 anytime soon). As far as riding this versus the mountain bike, the only real adjustments I've had to make are: no Camelbak (leaned too far over, and it's just ""un-roadie-like""); I loosened the stem and tilted the handlebar up so I could more comfortably ride with my hands on the hoods and effectively work the brakes; and of course I changed the saddle height and angle to preference. The difference in braking is the only significant adjustment. After the first long ride I could barely use my hands anymore because I was squeezing the brakes in a way that I don't have to on the mountain bike. Even a couple of months later, I'm still developing those braking muscles, but at least I can use the brakes now after several hours of riding. You might want to ease into road riding just for that reason alone. And of course it's a hell of a lot faster and easier to go than a mountain bike. The mountain bike simply doesn't move by comparison. At some point I actually felt the road bike was too easy, like I barely had to pedal, but then I just changed where and how I ride. If I were touring, this would be a breeze to ride in comparison to the tougher work on the mountain bike, and no less comfortable as far as I'm concerned.

Strength:
PriceGood componentsOnly minor upgrades needed


Weakness:
None for me (tires but that's expected)


OK, I've waited a long time to do my review. I bought the bike last August at a year end clearance to replace my 20 year old Univega. I weighed 215 lbs. on a 5'11"" frame and am 53 yrs. old. My son got me back into cycling and I needed to lose some weight and get in shape. Started out doing 5 to 6 miles loops 3 to 4 days per week. Am now doing 125 to 200 miles per week and do hills almost every day. I'm down to 178 lbs. I've put 3,850 miles on the bike. Yesterday I rode my first organized ride. It was an 80 mile ride with two large climbs in the first 20 miles and temperatures in the 90's. I passed many $3,000 to $4,000 carbon bikes along the way, especially on the hills. My buddy is right, it's the engine not the bike. This bike has done everything I hoped and more. Came with 105 shifters and fr, Ultegra crank and rd. Have had a couple of minor adjustments and one tuneup (I've learned to do most of the routine things myself). I did add Keo pedals and am on my second set of Ultra Gatorskins. I've kept the original seat and have never had a sore butt (maybe I'm lucky but why fix something that's not broken). This has been the best $899 I've ever spent

t the time I was a recreational rider, didn't even like hills back then. Joined a club and discovered hills. The bike was awesome then. Since then however I have developed into a road racer and have beat this bike into a pulp. Lots of miles have past however and I am a big heavy rider about 215lbs puttin out up to 1200 watts. I estimate about 10K road miles plus 3 winters worth of indoor riding on the trainer.

Strength:
* relatively light(aluminum/carbon)* above average component group (Shimano 105/Ultergra)* excellent value


Weakness:
* seat needs replacing ASAP


I am reviewing the Trek 1600 in this summary. After researching the web, reading magazine reviews, and visiting most bike shops in the central Florida area, I was set to buy the Trek 1500. When I went to Dave's to look one last time, I was introduced to the 1600. It was on sale and included upgrades from the 1500 - a carbon fork and seat post as well as an Ultegra rear derailleur. In a test ride of both the 1500 and 1600, it was a much smoother ride and seemed to handle easier. Since I purchased it over 3 months ago, I have replaced the Bontrager seat, and added aerobars and clipless pedals. I have had one flat and eventually plan to replace the tires with either Continentals or Michelins. I normally ride 10 miles after work during the week and take long rides of about 40-50 miles on the weekend. I would love to upgrade to a carbon bike, but I can't bring myself to spend that kind of money. I rated the 1600 an overall 4 since upgrading the 105 components to all Ultegra would improve this bike even more. For the price, the Trek 1600 is awesome and a big step up from the 1500!

Strength:
Full 105 gearing across the board.Carbon seat stays as well as carbon fork .Good all around frame .


Weakness:
Ok ,I must say that for a thousand dollar bike ,there is no way you can beat it's gearing specs ,weight,or frame.On the other hand ,it is a thousand dollar bike people: the brakes are marginal(I upgraded to ultegra).The wheels imo are not safe at high speeds and for riders above 230( I went with neuvation m28 aero 2's).Last but certainly not least,the seat is a joke. has no flex and poor cushioning.Easily bontragers worst effort in seats .


At the 1,000 to 1,500 price range,this bike imo has the best combination of attributes for it's price.I looked at the Trek 1600,fuji 1.0,several jamis's ,and Scott, this one fit my needs best ..That is not to say that it doesn't need upgrades,just that for it's price, it is a real value. I say this for two reasons,it's full 105 setup and the frame.Those two things alone are worth upwards of 1,200. As I said in the weaknesses ,it needs upgrades for sure but I felt like given it's strengths ,it was worth it . Good stock bike for the weekender,or good trainer/upgradable ride for more experienced folks.

Weakness:
I found the seat uncomfortable after a few hundred miles-I replaced it with a higher quality product;I have heard others complain about the Bontrager tires- but for my purposes they are fine;


This being my first road bike, I was looking for the best bike I could find under $1000. Trek had a promotion in 2007 featuring the 1500 and my LBS had a nice red 1500 priced at $875 - sold! I don't speak all the bike lingo, but basically this bike has been all that I had hoped for. I find it to be of high quality, lightweight, good-looking, fast(for my purposes), and something that should suit my needs for many years. I am a former distance runner that needed to get on a bike to save my knees. I ride just for enjoyment and personal fitness. I can get a great workout and feel no pain in my knees. After riding for awhile now, I wonder why I spent all those years running - the speed you get on a bike for the effort you put in is very rewarding. For me, the Trek 1500 has been a great bike. I feel I have a high quality product at a very reasonable price.I am one that likes quality, but I don't have to have the most expensive or the best. My rides have been an enjoyable experience - I feel like I have a quality product.

Weakness:

To start with, this bike retailed new at 1150 at my local bike shop last year. Even that price well fits the bike as it is equipped with 105 shifters and front d, as well as an ultegra crankset, bottom bracket, and rear d. i have been saving for quite some time for a new bicycle and have been test riding bikes left and right. the lateral stiffness on this bike is just where i want it to be, and the geometry places me in a position where i feel like im in a race every time i ride it. Some of the models come with full 105, which i would still recomend because the diffrence in the mechanics is very minimal. If your looking for a bicycle build with excellent quality, something stiff and light, something that climbs with passion every time you hit the hills, and ultimatley something under a 1000 bucks i highly recommend this bicycle... the only cons are the tires, and saddle are cheaply made and should be replaced if you are spending alot of time riding... to sum things up, this bike is truly a joy to ride every time i am on it (which is around 200 miles a week).

Strength:
The Shimano 105 shifting is quite effective.


Weakness:
Watch the wear on the crankset if you're really adding up the miles. Also the rear tire rim may go out of round just a hair. My bike store is great about giving this bike a spot check tune-up every month or so.


I purchased the Trek 1500 after looking at several other Trek designs. a Lemond Reno, and a similar package from Specialized.  I went with the Trek 1500 because this bike just seemed to feel right. After riding for two months, I finally got around to changing the Bontrager 25c tires it came with to Michelin Krylion Carbon 23C for about $80.00. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I immediately noticed the bike corners better at greater speed and angle and inspires much more confidence on faster descents. Change the pedals too. Upgrade to a nice clip in bike shoe. If your bike budget was under a $1000.00, this bike will not disappoint. But making at least those two upgrades will make your rides much more productive and enjoyable.

Tires are reported to be bad on this site, but I don't have any complaints. For the money, I couldn't be happier with the bike.


Great bike for the money. I have over 3000 miles (and only ONE flat!!!). I've test ridden the Madone carbon with XXX race wheels - it was better on the climbs, but similar on the flatlands. No way I'd spend the money for a Madone when I love this bike at 1/4th the cost... and it's almost as nice.

Strength:
Top notch Bontrager/Shimano 105 combo. Great premorming and good looking paired spoke wheels. Compact crankset. Frame remains stiff while sprinting.


Weakness:
Stock Bontrager 700x25c tires are a little sluggish, easy fix. Seat a little wide for my bum, personal preference item.


I am really happy with every feature of this bike. I race criteriums and this bike is fully suited for that purpose. With a compact crankset (39/53) and a 9 speed Shimano 105 gruppo, it's light, responsive and a joy to ride. The carbon fork and seatpost by Bontrager are top quality and smooth out the ride. I highly recommend this from the club rider to the beginning and intermediate criterium racer.

Strength:
Some of the strengths of the 1500 include, sturdy frame that has a life time Guaranty and it offers great mid-range components with shimano 105's.


Weakness:
As you will read many people are unsatisfied with the lackluster wheel package associated with this bike. The fact, wheels will make a creaking noise when rider is out of the sadle. All that needs to be done is, tighten the tension of the spokes. This can be done fairly easliy by most quailfied mechanics.


The trek 1500 is a great entry level bike. Trek has built this bike on a sold frame which make it quite versital for many applications. THis bike is aimedfor people with a budget constraint of 900-1100 dollars. My personal uses for this bike have included everything from comuting to work to placing in the top 20% in sprint triathlons. Im curently at 1500+ miles and the only thing i added was a pair of areobars for my triathlons.

Strength:
Frame, 105 and Ultegra components.


Weakness:
Tires and brakes.


I have to agree about the stock tires. After about 5 flats, the rear tire blew out and was beyond repair. I swapped on the tires from my old bike and the front tire blew out on the first ride due to a sharp edge on the rim at the seam (but those tires were O-L-D, which probably contributed). So I filed the sharp edge, mounted a pair of Kevlar-belted Continentals and all is well. I also found the Cane Creek brakes so-so at best, so when I found a set of 105 calipers at a good price, I bought them -- much stronger, smoother and more predictable. While all of this sounds negative, I really do like the bike -- the frame is light and stiff without being harsh and the 105/Ultegra drivetrain works flawlessly. At this price point you're always going to find some compromises on the parts but the big things, the frame, the drivetrain, and the wheels, are all just fine.

The tyres. The stock front tyre imploded on my first decent ride.


I have been 'out of the saddle' for ten years and was looking for an entry level bike to get back into the sport. Plan to get a few miles in my legs and then perhaps compete in a few triathlons and group rides. I decided on the 1500 due to the fit and the excellent spec The Aus model for 2007 has full Ultegra and at this price ($1899 AUS) there were few bikes spec'd similarly. I now have a few hundred k's on the bike and am very happy with it. It is very responsive, yet comfortable and the Ultegra gear is a dream to use.

Stock Bontrager saddle. Maybe if I gave it a proper break-in, it might have come around, but it was still going to be a relatively heavy saddle compared to my old Avocet O2 (which was already broken in from years of service)


The geometry and crossbreeding of equipment manufactures comes together to provide a bike that is simply a wonderful experience to ride. My last two bikes were great, but they each had flaws. One was a bit too weak torsionally (full carbon fiber TUBED bike). The other was too rigid and agile for any comfort at all (Metal Matrix frame with agressive geometry). The Trek 1500 SLR provides me with everything I want and need. I look forward to years of enjoyment from the Trek!

I have not been a road rider for about 10 years. I recently purchased a Trek 4300 mountain bike and after riding a while I wanted to get back into road riding. First I purchased a Trek 7.5 fitness bike but was very dissapointed with its performance. After considering several models I chose the 1500. I love it. It handles very well and is great for climbs and it has very good speed. The frame is stiff and smooth. I have only rode it for about 300 miles so far but I have no major complaints other than the saddle is rough and I am going to replace it. I have noticed a lot of complaints on the tires but so far I am happy with them. I mainly ride 10-15 miles most every day and some times maybe a half century or two a year. This bike is perfect and I feel it will meet my needs for many years to come.

Great beginner's bike!I have always had a good recreational mountain bike but have always wanted a road bike. I am getting into seeing how far/ fast i can go. After visiting many LBS dealers the Bike Nashbar website and a local Peformance Bike shop, I rode several models priced from $700 to $1100. At just under $800, the Trek 1500 offers awesome value for the money. This bike is different worth the $150 premium over the Trek 1000. While the tires are very cheam, I will probally replace them by next season. The peddles are cheap but are good to learn with. They may be leaving by next year. The 105 system shifts very smooth and performs well. While a 10 speed would be nice, as in the 1600, I did not let this become my decider point. Handling is good and while the ride was not as well as the Specialized Robaix with the Zertz inserts, the $300 price break is welcomed.

Weakness:
Very limited. All I can come up with is a 9-speed drivetrain and maybe the non-carbon fiber seatstays which seems pretty common on bikes starting around this price now.


Awesome bike for the money! As with it seems all Treks, the 1500 offered the most for the money. With the step up to SLR aluminum, Shimano 105 drivetrain, high quality Bontrager components, and excellent overall value, the 1500 is hard to be beat. I was in the market for a nice tri bike such as a QR Kilo, but the pocketbook didn't quite allow and I figured there was more to be had in my legs than in my bike. So, I bought the 1500, threw on a set of carbon Profile aerobars, and ride it all the time with no regrets! Plus, there's nothing like riding by the guy with the carbon fiber bike, all while still having enough cash in the pocket to have a nice lunch after a good long ride! :D

This is my first road bike and I love it so far. I have done a few good 1 hour rides on within the first 5 days of owning it and really like it. This bike is fast, agile, strong, light and responsive. Its got great acceleration and smooth ride. The steering is quick and responsive and I feel confident blasting through turns. Shifting is quick w/ only a little noise due to not-quite-perfect adjustment. I'm a little nervous going over cracks or dips in the pavement tho because it seems sketchy on the 25cm tires (only rode mtb before now). The brakes are strong but my pads seem to wear quickly and get brake dust stuck to the frame. I am very satisfided w/ this bike as a short distance commuter and weekend-racer, fun-time ride. This bike also has an Ultegra crankset and RD, as well as Cane Creek brakes and headset, which wasn't suppose to be fitted on the 2007 model.

I have owned this bike for about 500 miles. Climbs well and nice paint quality(red). Upgraded the brakes and wheels after reading the reviews. Not one problem with frame, fork, or components. DO NOT buy this bike if you have owned a Cannondale. You will be disappointed in the harsh ride and the twitchy handling.

Strength:
Great bike for a great price.


Weakness:
My bike 63 cm and I am a large person. I average about 220 pounds. If you are a large rider and you purchase this bike inspect the wheels frequently. Mine are Bontrager select 24 spoke rear and 20 spoke front on Bontrager hubs. I discovered that many of the eyelets where the spoke nipples rest have cracked on the rear wheel. This could be a huge safety issue if not detected early. In addition, I have always noticed some noise from each of the hubs which my LBS could not explain, needless to say my new wheels are much quieter and stiffer. And I am running 32 spokes now. I replaced them with some Mavic Open Pros with Ultegra hubs on sale at performance. Oh and my LBS reminded me that there is only a 1 year warranty on the wheels that I just barely missed.


This is a follow up review. Overall I still feel that this bike was a good value. I really like the bike and I plan to ride it for many years to come. I now have about 3000 miles on the bike.

I bought this bike last june and have put about 3000 miles on it. This is my first road bike, but as an avid mt biker I find road biking and this trek be a zen like experience. It climbs, handles and shifts very well, enough that as a non-racer I don't think I'll never need to buy another road bike. I tried a plethora of other brands, and none fit as well as the trek, at least in my subjective experience. I highly recommend this bike, especially over the 2007 model.

Strength:
Frame, 105 Group, Carbon fork and post, rims. Basically everything


Weakness:
The brake pads, in essence just leave them at the store. The cane creek scr 3's are good brakes but the shimano pads are horrible, just spend the extra 20 bucks and get kool stops put on the bike before you leave the store. The tires are OK but i'd recommend upgrading to something else, you'll save money on tubes in the long run (at least that is the experience my roommate has had)


My first road bike. As a college student I didn't really have money to buy a top of the line bike. Luckily I purchased a Trek 1500 and ended up getting one anyway. I've been riding a Schwinn Mesa since I was about 15, doing 50-60 miles a week during the warm parts of the year in Wisconsin. This Spring i decided it was time for a new bike. After trying out the 1000 i was sold, then i tried the 1500 and i was sold again. The 1500 has everything a biker who isn't going to be racing will ever need. After only 5 days of owning the bike I've put on 167 miles and pretty much spend my days on the road. The Trek 1500 is an excellent bike and with a few minor upgrades you'll be good for miles upon miles.

Strength:
Good stiffness, easy shifting, acceptable weight and last but not least great looks (Discovery Team coulors). While Trek 1500 is not the last word in road bikes, I belive a significantly better bike would require a very different price tag. Especially in Norway.


Weakness:
Wheels not as fast as they probably should be.


Trek 1500 bought at a good price according to Norwegian standards. Limited experience with road bikes and wanted to start off with something fairly moderate, was not disapponited. After having adjusted my riding position a few times (seat back and forth as well as trying stems ranging from 90mm-120mm), I have finally found a bike with which I am very happy and which I feel comfortable riding.

Purchased this bike as an upgrade from my 1993 Trek 1420. Not that there was anything wrong with the old Trek as it still functioned flawlessly and rode great, I just thought it was time for something new. After reading numerous bike reviews and test riding several other makes (Cannondale, Scott, Specialized) in the $1000-2000 range I decided to stick with the Trek. Since I haven't had it that long I have not put tons of miles on it yet, but yesterday I did a 57 miler on it without any complaints whatsoever. I have it equipped with a double chainring and ride in very rolling and hilly terrain and it climbed wonderfully. It is also very fast going down the other side! Handles well, brakes well, shifts great. Red color scheme with black fork looks sharp! Overall, a real fine bike for the money. I could have spent as much as $500-700 more for one of the others I mentioned but I don't know that I would have been any happier.

Had a steel frame in the early 90's. Just recently got back into cycling. This is a great ride so far for the value. Would recommend this bike to a beginner. Light with good components. Shifts gears like butter. Climbs well and goes downhill like a demon. I have the red paint scheme, it looks really sharp. No problems other than some wheel flex (brake rub) and front wheel noise while out of the saddle. Tightened the spokes slightly and it seems better. Will update at around six months riding!

Ten days After running my first Marathon here in Little Rock I broke my foot. Cross training was encouraged by all my doctors, so I started biking. The 1500 was an upgrade. Very pleased. I'm not experienced so I can't comment on all the technical details. The bike is comfortable, shifts easily and reliably. Here in the central Arkansas area we have lots of hills and the bike is well suited to make the hills easy. The bike was built with an Ultegra derailleur, so I got a particularly good deal.  I recommend this bike for anyone looking for an entry level road bike.

Weakness:
I havent mentioned this. It can dent quite easily, although very much unnoticable.


Im here to review about the frame only, since I only bought the frameset. That means that the price stated above is only for the frameset. It's an aluminum double-butted frame with a Bontrager carbon fork. I equipped the Trek 1500 frame (model 2006) with an '07 Ultegra groupset, Shimano WH-R550 wheelsets and hubs, and the rest is average. The result; a really responsive bike. Excellent cornering, stiff enough to climb easy on even the steepest mountains, and a great aerodynamic feel. Nice color too. I got the blue one and the paint job has a duotone color. The fork also is not like some typical forks where only the front area of its tip is the skewer lock. The whole bottom end of the fork is the skewer lock. It has a monocoque design. Personally, it makes me feel safer. Although there are alot better framesets around, its makes a perfect entry-level frameset.

Select wheels aren't bad, just needed a little attentionBontrager Triple, heavy, creaky, didn't like it. Tiagra Front DR, only thing on the bike that wasn't at least 105 when I got it


This is an update to a review I did on this bike in March 06. Since then, I have put about 2800 miles on it, and I still love it. I did change a few things, namely the Front DR and the Bontrager triple to an Ultegra DR and 105 crank. The Bonti was making a lot of noise and was very heavy, and I hadn't been in the small ring since June, so I replaced it and the Bottom Bracket. Definately made a difference in the feel of the bike. The Bontrager Selects aren't the best on the market by far, and the spoke tension was really low when I got it, so that the wheels were rubbing on the brakes when I was hammering out of the saddle or climbing, but a few quick turns with the spoke wrench solved that. Other than that, I have been very satisfied with this bike. I have raced on it, done a few organized long rides (75+ miles) and thousands of miles with no one but me and maybe one or two other guys. The bike is comfortable, responsive, fairly light and just a great first bike. I'll eventually get something nicer, but for now I am going to ride the wheels off of this one.

Weakness:
Wheels and tires, saddle


I bought this bike to race with, on the advise of a local pro. He said it was a good bike to start with. My bike came with the ultegra crankset, which is really nice. Not a whole lot of flex in the crank or the frame. Some of the roads here in mississippi can be pretty rough on a rider, this bike does ok with vibration dampening. This bike does everything well. I ride with people with much more expensive bikes than me, and this bike doesn't hold me back. The only things about this bike that aren't good are the seat, tires, and wheels. Wheels aren't stiff enough, tires aren't durable enough, and the seat flat out hurts.

Strength:
Relative to its class, excellent power transfer, this bike surges ahead in a rewarding fashion. Stable, predictable handling. Great build quality, takes hard riding without breaking or needing constant adjustment.Beautiful paint job and nice clean looking welds on frame.Carbon fork and seatpost.


Weakness:
Clipless pedals not standard. Stock seat is marginal.Stock tires don't perform as well as higher quality replacements.Had I been a little more savvy I would have opted for the double instead of the triple ring as my usual course is pretty flat. (FL)


After some 1500 miles riding for recreation and fitness I can say this bike is a tremendous value. It felt quicker with better power transfer than the Felt, Giant and Cannondale bikes I tried. I am 5'8"" and tend to stretch out after getting warmed up, the 54 cm frame fits me perfectly. You can pay a lot more for only incremental increases in performance. That said I immediately upgraded to clipless pedals and bike shoes. This will be the first and most rewarding upgrade to do. Also the standard seat is marginal and an upgrade here is worthy. I just replaced the stock Bontrager select tires. The rear started to flat. After a lot of reading this forum's tire reviews I just installed new Continental GP 4000's and new Continental tubes. Wow, what a difference in acceleration, rolling resistance and especially cornering. The Continentals stick in the corners in a confidence inspiring way. I corner faster and sharper in the same turns I took with the stock tires. There is a distinct improvement in comfort and road feel at the same time.I added a Cateye Micro wireless computer. This is a good basic inexpensive bike computer that keeps track of most of what I want and I love the clean wireless installation. Got a Topeak small wedge seat bag that just has room for cell phone, CO2 inflator, patch kit and Trek multitool. This is all the bike you need for recreational and fitness riding. Performance is exhilarating enough to make you anticipate your next chance to ride.

Bought this bike last year after rediscovering how much I loved and missed riding. Did some homework and talked to a few people, but I probably wasn't as well informed as I should have been before making a purchase. The '06 Discovery Team paint really caught my eye and I took the plunge. I totally lucked out and all I can say is that I'm thrilled with this rig. It's not the lightest bike on the road, but then again I'm not the lighterst rider at 210 lbs. It's stiff as an oak (seems that every ounce of pedal stroke translates into forward motion) handles like it's on rails and descends like the devil himself is on your tail. Although I can't comment on carbon frames, I can't say enough about the smooth, quiet ride and haven't really noticed any vibration problems on my hands or behind, even on longer rides up to 80k. It's not a competitive crit bike (at least not under this rider)nor was it designed to be. I have although done a couple of duathlons and the bike acquitted itself admirably. If you're a recreational rider looking for an absolutely rock solid bike with great manners and awesome bang for the buck look no further. As far as I'm concerned this bike's only limitations are in it's rider's abilities. If you're looking, don't want to spend a huge bundle and this bike fits...buy it now...you won't be disappointed.

Strength:
good solid frame with an aggressive geometry. Full 105 component group.


Weakness:
Nothing yet...maybe the stock saddle


So far, the Trek 1500 is a great bike for entry level riders. I must admit, this is my first road bike (I ride mtn but needed something to train during regular days) and after putting in hours of research and a bunch of test rides, the Trek 1500 07 came out on top. This bike has an aggressive geometry so if you desire to let it go, you go. The component group is good for the price however I did find other bikes with better components (but its all about the fit right?) Overall, the Trek 1500 is a great fit with a good set of components which i got at the right price

Strength:
The Bontrager Select wheels are really nice, they have a low spoke count, are fairly light, and and have stayed true after some big pot holes. Of course, the wheels could be lighter, but for a $1000 bike they are great. The Frame is laterally stiff and gives great power transfer for climbing hills and sprinting. My bike came with Cane Creek SCR 3 brakes which work great. Full Shimano 105 drivetrain has very smooth and crisp shifting, don't think I would upgrade to Ultegra unless I was a serious racer. It is nice that they now offer the 1500 as a double instead of just the triple.


Weakness:
I think the saddle is definately the weakest part of the bike. On rides over 20 or 25 miles my butt usually starts to hurt. This will probably be the first thing I upgrade, but it is fine for now. The Bontager Select tires are also not that great, but these are obviously something that will be replaced in the future anyways, and I will wait to replace them until I get some good wear on them. Other than these 2 things that most people replace and have personal preferences for anyways, everything else on this bike is a strength.


I got the new 2007 model and I love it so far. The red paint scheme looks awesome. I decided to get a double, because I didn't really think the triple was needed in Ohio, and so far it has been fine even on some pretty good sized hills in southern Ohio. I have riden about 500 miles so far and haven't had a single problem. My last bike was an old steel 12 speed, so everything about the 1500 seems really light and smooth. I test rode several other bikes including the Trek 1000 and 2100. I could notice a big difference from the 1000, so I think if you are able, it is definately worth it to get 105 components instead of Sora or Tiagra. I couldn't really notice a difference in the 2100 on a test ride because it basically had the same components, however on long rides the carbon seat stays might be nice to have, because on long rides (50 miles or more), I start to really feel the vibrations, but this could be the saddle or my butt not being used to doing long rides. Overall, this is an awesome bike and I love to ride.

Strength:
Climbing, handling, shifters, braking, good looks. Quality bike and quality local bike shop.


Weakness:
Ride seems a bit firm after hours in the saddle, even with carbon for and post. Might end up with new shorts out of the deal.


Had my eye on this bike for awhile, not wanting to part with the money. The purchase was well worth it. This bike can take all you can dish out. The shifting is precise, the braking excellent. The frame is stiff laterally, but more compliant vertically, but still a firm ride expecially after 50 miles or more,even with carbon post and fork. The wheels are suprisingly strong for low spoke count. Tires haven't needed to be trued even after 1500 miles. The only adjustments needed this year were front derailer and snug up the head set. I did upgrade to a Specialized Avatar seat which fits my bottom better and Continental 3000 tires for less rolling resistance. I wasn't impressed with the stock tires. Tires didn't seem very lively and flatted easily. I've had numerous positive comments as to the good looks of this bike. It holds its own in about any arena. Twice, I've taken the bike to the summit of Trailridge Road in Estes Park CO, no problems up or down. It is a pretty good climber and descender. I'm very satisfied with this bike and have great confidence in it.

Strength:
Stiff ride from the aluminium frame offers great control. Whenever the bike slides, it remains controllable. Ultegra gruppo is excellent, although it will be sublime once I have had my complementary bike service done on it. Tyres are good for stockers, though less rolling resistance would be nice.


Weakness:
The stiff ride, combined with Newcastle, Australia's bad roads makes for some uncomfortable jolts at times. Other than that my only complaint is that my abilities are not up to that of the bikes...yet.


This is my first road bike, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. Having ridden mountain bikes throughout my childhood and was instantly addicted by the amazing ease at which the speed comes on one of these things. I was particularly impressed with the entire gearset, which provides slick, accurate shifting as you power into the wind. For the price I paid, as an entry level racing package, I don't think you can beat it unless you spend alittle more and go for say a Cervelo Team Soloist.

Waited for a few months to write a more objective review. I have ~400 miles on the bike now, and I still love it as much as I did when I got it. Hooked up on a deal with it being a 2005 model, came with Ultegra on the rear, rest is 105. Ride is nice, feels fast, downhills are stable and fun, and it is not too harsh for aluminum. Highly recommended for this price range - excellent fit and excellent bike.

Strength:
The bike climbs, shifts, and corners well.


Weakness:
The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but I don't yet know if that's me needing to get used to it or if a different seat would be better. I have also noticed the creaking sound during climbing other reviewers have noted, but it doesn't seem to hurt anything.


My bike reviewed is actually a 2006 Discovery Channel edition. Shifters & RD are 105, but the FD & cranks are Ultegra, 2 rings up front. I've been mtn biking for a few years and have only been road riding for about a month - I borrowed a bike to prep for the MS 150 and immediately fell in love with road riding. After a few hundred miles I'm still thrilled with this bike. I also checked out the Trek 1000, 1200, and Giant OCR2 when I decided to go ahead and buy a bike. The 1500 is worth the extra money - even if it means delaying your purchase - the improvement in quality makes a big difference. As in guitars (or anything else) you'll not always be a novice so buying more quality than you need at the moment keeps you from regretting your purchase in a few months.

Strength:
Stiffness, acceleration, handling (for a road bike), riding position. Good components for the price. Ultegra cranks and 105 RD work great.


Weakness:
I will swap out the brake pads - they have sub-par stopping power. If that does not work, I'll upgrade the calipers. Also, had problems with the 105 FD popping the chain while switching chainrings going uphill. I tweaked it and all seems good for now - we'll see. I only have about 50 mile on the bike so far.


This is for 2006 model with Discovery graphics - 58cm frame. Like many reviewers here, this is my first road bike. I was a BMX racer in my youth, moved to mountain bikes in college. For the past few years I've been doing family rides on our excellent local trails on my MTB. However, after about 10 miles, it gets pretty taxing and I was unable to keep up with folks on proper road bikes. I went to the LBS thinking I wanted a hybrid, but them tested the Trek 1000 and realized that I wanted a road bike. Tried the 1500, and wow it is a MUCH better feeling bike for only a little more cash. The second day I owned the bike, I did a 15 mile charity ride and was easily able to keep up with the group leaders riding way more expensivbe bikes (and who were way more experienced road riders). I am very happy.

Strength:
Fairly lightweight at 19 lbs.Smooth shifting. Can be upgraded and will keep up with any aluminum bike on the road. Strong up the hills.Excellent paint and accessories.


Weakness:
Seat hurts, but what seat doesn't.


2006 Trek 1500. I previously owned a mid 90's Trek 1200 14 speed. I had upgraded the bike to STI shifters and had the bike tuned. I have begun competing in Triathlons and found that my friends were killing me on the cycling portion of the race. I had spent about the same amount of time training on the bike as my peers was being beat by 9 or 10 minutes in just 15 miles. I decided to look into upgrading and it was the best decision I could have made. After my first ride which was windy, I had already gained 1.5 miles per hour average and the course was quite a bit hillier than the course I normally ride. This bike allows you to power up the hills, and really accelerate down the hills and in the flats. At one point I actually got a little scared because I was not used to going that fast. I was able to reach much greater speeds with less effort. This bike is a steal for the price I paid. I added on DEDA Aero bars and wireless speedometer.

It's been quite sometime since I was on a road bike. I'm an avid runner in the summer but the knees just can't hold up anymore. I have a friend that has been biking for years and he really enjoys the riding and exercise. A few months ago I decided to do some research around rode bikes and narrowed my choices down to the Trek 1500 and 5000. I felt the 1500 was a better for what I needed to get out of the bike so that's what I bought. After 3 weeks I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The fit and finish is top quality. The ride is smooth but at the same time it feels sturdy. In 3 weeks I have 150+ miles.

This is my first road bike. I decided I wanted to compete in triathalons and asked around to see what would fit all my needs. I ride my bike everywhere I go. It's mid July now and I haven't filled my gas tank in my truck since the first week of May. I put about 150 miles on my bike a week and I carry everything I need in a backpack. I'm not a fan of the handlebars. The drops are fine but the rest is kind of awkward. I like the seat. The tape on the handle bars came undone in the first 2 weeks. beautiful paintjob. Light as feather and stronge as ox. Takes my daily commute like a champ and keeps me in contention in my tri races.

Strength:
Ultegra rear derailleur shifts nicely. Requires minor adjustments after a few hilly days as any other bike. Pretty light bike considering the component setup...i think somewhere around 22. Carbon Fork and seatpost. dampen some of the rattling. All around good deal for your money though


Weakness:
ive noticed a lot of flex going on in the bottom bracket area just due to the lower end frame make. Not too thrilled about the weight of the Bontrager select wheels, although durable. A lot of rattling from the road, not much gets absorbed. I hate the saddle. After a while it really starts to soften and flex creating some minor back pain every now and then on the trainer.


For an entry level training bike to a just for fun cruiser this is a pretty good starter bike. I started biking about one and a half years ago and i have put a little over 4000 on it, so obviously i have noticed alot. Basically some pretty reliable components put on a basic frame made out of aluminum.....you get the picture. Definitely not something you would buy if your a serious racer. but really good for training. I would really advise going up to the 2200 and get carbon if your willing to spend a little extra cash, cause its really not worth it to put new expensive parts on this bike unless your goignt to get a new bike and your getting the components first

For a good entry level bike, it would hard to go wrong with the Trek 1500. I bought a 2006 today and just got back from a little spin. Very solid bike, good bang for your buck.

rides seem rough. does anyone really get comfortable on a road bike?? if i can ever afford another bike i'll see, but to date i doubt it.


pretty good, but lets not get carried away. this is an entry level road bike. i don't think any entry level bikes should be given a ""5"" rating overall. i think spending 800 dollars more is worth it if you can afford it to get a softer ride.

Strength:
The Trek 1500 is a beautiful bike. Some excellent parts. Fun to ride and look at. Excellent performer once I spiffed it up.


Weakness:
Too much junk mixed in with the good. Would not recommend for anyone who just wants to buy a bike and ride it, without getting into the upgrades.


I'm a year into road-biking and agressively learning all I can about the sport. My first bike was a Masi Nouva Strada, which I still own and use while I'm in Hawaii. The Trek is my home bike in New Hampshire. I love both bikes, but I have a problem with what I find is an uneven build on the Trek. The frame, fork, handlebar (although I've replaced it with an EC-90), wheelsets, cassette seem good. The Ultegra rear derailleur is excellent. But, the saddle and (no-name)brakes were terrible and immediately replaced. The tires went pretty quickly, replaced with narrower 23's, and it performs much better. After about five hundred miles, the front chainring was throwing the chain due too wear (it was a no name set of steel gears with Bontrager cranks) and the bottom bracket (a bottom grade Giga Pip) was squeaking. I changed them out with Ultegras and they are much better. I've had trouble from day one with the 105 front derailleur (as have two real bike mechanics) and have ordered an Ultegra hoping that will help. I love riding the bike, and I love tinkering, so it hasn't been too big an imposition. But, it seems like a tremendous amount of work almost necessary on a new bike. My Masi has been maintenance free (other than routine) with a full Shimano Deore package that works great, with a few more miles on it than the Trek.

Strength:
Smooth ride for an aluminum frame. Ultegra rear derailleur. Good power transfer. Cool color scheme. Overall value.


Weakness:
Front derailleur can be a little sloppy. Stock pedals and brake pads suck. New tires would be a good idea too.


After hearing ""passing on your left"" too many times on my MTB, I decided to invest in a road bike. My choices came down to the Giant OCR 1 and the Trek 1500 (both 2006 models). I chose the 1500 based on the Ultegra rear derailleur (most of the other components were comparable) and because it was on sale. Overall, I'm very well satisfied. It's nimble with excellent power transfer, light-weight, and shifts like a dream compared to my MTB clunker, although the front der sometimes needs a little extra attention. My only regret is going with a triple crank instead of the double, being that I never find myself needing the ""granny gear"" like I did with my MTB. Otherwise, a great choice for the entry level rider who demands performance and comfort.

Strength:
Handling and ride. The 105 shifters, front der. + ultegra rear work well together. The Bontrager select wheels are fairly heavy but mine have held up inspite of some heavy, sometimes rough use.


Weakness:
brake calipers, get 105s! The Bontrager Select tires must go as well, upgrage to Conti gator skin or GP3000's. The stock saddle isn't that bad, I really switched for I wanted to try the cut out type + the Koobi is alot lighter.


Purchased this '05 model during Labor day weekend '04. It was my first bike purchase since the mid '80s to get me back into road riding. I did some research before pulling the trigger and the 1500 seemed like the way to go and it has been a great bike. after 500 miles, I switched out the calipers (which, beside the stock tires and saddle are the bikes only draw backs) with silver 105's, put on Conti GP 3000's and a Koobi AU Enduro saddle. I also switched out the 42 tooth middle ring with a 39 so now I'm dealing with a 52/39/30 and a 12/25 cassette so things never get so steep (at least to date and this includes several mtn rides in N. Georgia) that we haven't been able to handle. The red/white & blue paint is a bit flashy for my tastes but I've grown to like it. All in all, the Trek 1500 is an excellent bike (especially for the money), a major value if you will.

Strength:
High quality aluminum frame, great looks, Ultegra rear derailleur, overall great ride.


Weakness:
Finicky front derailleur (105). (Maybe it would work smoother with a double vs. a triple crank). Also, I think this bike should have SPD505 or -520 pedals standard.


This is for the 2006 model. I'm an entry level roadie, having used more traditional bikes, an old steel road bike from the 70's and a mountain bike. I was originally considering a Trek 1000 or 1200, as well as the Giant OCR 2. After reading reviews here, and studying components, I decided to go with this bike. The experience so far has been great. Compared to my previous rides, this was like upgrading from a sedan to a sports car. The frame is responsive, not too harsh. Power to the pedals gets directly to the rear wheel without any lag. Cornering at speed feels very stable- almost like being on rails.  I had some trouble with the saddle at first, but found a few tweaks in the adjustment solved it. (For me, it was bringing the nose up slightly- which keeps the biggest part of my buhunkus on the widest part of the saddle.) The appearance of the frame is very impressive for this price range. The color looks cool, and the aluminum frame looks like it came out of a mold- no weld marks. I've had to do some adjusting on the front derailleur (Shimano 105) to curb it's tendency to spit the chain off. Fortunately, Felix, the service guy at the LBS was able to cure it. On the other hand (or other end of the drive train) the Ultegra in the rear has been flawless. Personally, I've never experienced shifting this precise and smooth. If you're looking for a quality road bike, at an entry level price, this is a great pick.

Strength:
Excellent frame and compnents, especially if you can find one set up with the Ultegra drivetrain and shifters. Bontrager wheelset is great.


Weakness:
Nothing unique, almost everyone has a Trek. But try to find a better deal in the bike market.


This review is for a 2006 Trek 1500 in the Discovery Channel paint scheme. I found this bike recently a local shop, set up with Ultegra shifters, crank, and derailleurs. It seems Trek built a limited number of these, normally it comes with 105 shifters/front derailleur and a Bontrager crank. I was able to put 70 miles on this bike the first day, it is an excellent ride. I can only compare it to the 35 year old Peugeot PX-10 I've been riding for all those years. I don't think there is a better deal in the bike market right now.

Weakness:
None


I have enjoyed reading the reviews on this site which helped me quite a bit in making my decision regarding the recent purchase of my Trek 1500. Many years ago I was an avid cyclist..my main bike was a Centurion Ironman which I traded my brother for in the late 80's..he eneded up with my MTN and I ended up with a pretty nice road bike for the time. I was a cycling enthusiast back then...rode all the time and subscribed to all the Bicycling magazines..you name it I was hooked! But over the years cycling took a back seat to raising a family and developing a career..but the cycling bug hit me again recently and I began to seriously consider getting back into it..my first thought was to overhaul my Centurion but after pulling it out of the attic and dusting off all the years it dawned on me that bikes had evolved over the years and it would make much more sense to jump into the new technologies! Well..after talking to a couple of cycling enthusiasts I slowly made my way through the local bike shops...surfed the net..sites such as this..and read Bicycling's buyer's guide...armed with all this knowledge and resources and with the help of a very well informed sales guy I made the plunge and purchase a Trek 1500 just last weekend! Let me tell you...that afternoon I took it out for an 8 mile ride around my beatiful, tree lined neighborhood and was in bike heaven!! The technology has changed and for the better! The carbon fiber forks and seatpost provided a vibration free ride and the Ultegra rear deraillera and 105 components as well as the Bontrager wheelset..etc made for a very nice ride indeed! I love the look of this bike..no welding scars..fairly light and well equipped for under a grand! I plan on riding it a lot in the next few weeks and months and will come back with a revised review but for the moment I am greatly pleased with my choice and with the addition of a Trek Incite computer have enjoyed tracking my mileage and average speed..etc.. This bike has dropped 10 years from this middle aged body of mine and I hope to participate in some charity races in the near future! I would highly recommend this bike to anyone looking to spend at the most $1000..you definitely get your money's worth and more!! The components are all solid and the bike is aesthetically pleasing to the eye!! Nice Discovery Team colors..it's a 2006 by the way!  There is not a better way I can think of to get in shape..it all goes back to your childhood when your bike was the most important possession of your young life...I think that even holds true in adult years.. Go get one today..you won't be disappointed...

Strength:
Look, Speed (I hit 33.7 today into the wind), ride quality, components, price.


Weakness:
only thing I don't like is the front DR (i am not even going to attempt to spell that word) It is the only piece of the drivetrain that is Tiagra, and it just seems sloppy. The other is the brakes, no names and really loud most of the time. Not confidence-inspiring.


This is my first Road Bike as well. I started road biking late last year on my old Trek 820, putting in up to 100 miles in a week. That kind of millage on an 820 is kind of like going to get milk in a tank. I dropped the knobbies for some more road-friendly tires, but still wanted a real bike. I demoed a few (Giant, Raleigh, Trek) and knew that I would never get out of the doghouse if I spent too much money on this, so when I saw the 2004 1500 in my size for $899.00 and found a coupon for $50.00 off, I jumped on it. I am absolutely amazed at the speed, the smoothness, the lightness of the bike compared to the steel mtb. The bike really seems to want to GO. It is nice to know that if I am slowing down over the hills, it is the fault of the overweight guy in the saddle, not the overweight bike underneath him. I can't wait for the weather to warm up a bit, riding 15-20 miles in the beginning of the season at 29 degrees is brutal, but I am smiling every minute. This seems to be a great bike for someone who wants to get into riding for real, get in great shape, do some events but not go professional in the next 5 years or so. The frame is light and strong enough that if you feel the need to upgrade the ultegra/105 components, it wouldn't be a waste. All in all, a great bike, reliable, fast and ready for the rider to catch up to it.

Strength:
Stiff and light frame (approx 19 pounds for a 60cm built bike)- great trainer or budget racer.


Weakness:
none now


After reading the other reviews, I purchased a bare 60cm 2005 Trek 1500 frame and built it as noted in the build section that follows. I saw the potential in the frame and wanted to avoid the pitfalls of the stock Trek build. The Ultegra grouppo is lighter than the 105 and the 50/34 chainring coupled with a 11-23 cassette gives me plenty of low and high gears to keep my cadence right. This frame deserves a light build and responds to 23C tires and tight gearing. It is too bad that the stock Trek build was designed to meet a budget at the expense of performance. If you bought a stock 1500, you could consider these upgrades in lieu of replacing the bike for a new one.

This is my first road bike, however I demoed quite a few while I was looking. Although I feel that the Specialized Allez Elite either double or triple is probably a better bang for ones buck, I didn't care for their compact geometery. This bike is amazing, its very light and the ultegra rear deraileur sells the bike itself. This whole shifting system is incredible.  I do see what people say about the tires being a bit slow, but everything seems great, save the stock saddle, I plan to swap that out for the Specialized Avaitar.

Weakness:

possibly the wheelset...TBD


I wrecked my previous road bike - a Fuji Newest - in October when I was hit by a car, and have not ridden on the road since. I just recently started shopping around for a new road bike, and was looking in the $1000-1300 range; looked at the Cannondale R900, Specialized Allez Elite, and the Trek 1500. The Trek just seemed to feel a touch better than the others - even than the famed compact geometry of the Specialized, which surprised me. For the $950 (10% off the $1050 MSRP since it was an 05), I also felt I was getting more than the $1200 Specialized and the $1400 cannondale (though the frame, unfortunately, is not made in the USA). 

First impression when I picked up the bike: the frame colors (white, red and blue) are beautiful. The SLR tubing welding seems flawless, even though the frame is manufactured in Taiwan.

Today was my first road ride since October 18 (when I was hit), and the first ride on the new 1500. First off, let me say that I am very stoked to be road riding in mid-January in Maine!

Anyway, I swapped out the stock saddle/seatpost and put on my old profile fast-forward and trico-split rail saddle. I might swap out for a shorter stem as well. Otherwise, the bike was stock, aside from Shimano R-540 pedals.

First thing I noticed as I pulled out of my driveway: the Bontrager tires roll verrryyy slow. Not sure if this is the fault of the wheelset or the tires (I suspect the tires, since others complain about them). The tires will be the first thing to go...planning on slapping my older Vredstein's on. Hopefully that will make a difference. 

I still need to get fully fit to the geometry of the Trek, but this first ride felt very good. All shifting was crisp (love the Ultegra rear; much improvement over my Fuji's Tiagra), and the 105 front derailleur felt good too. I agree with most reviewers - the stock brakes need to go - they just don't stop that well!

The bike felt good, stiff and responsive to pedal input, though I need to get used to it in the turns. The wheelset seems fine now, but we'll see how it holds up.
I plan to throw some aero bars on and adjust the geometry for some time trial/duathlons, so we'll see how that goes. 

The 1500 seems better than my Fuji Newest, which is comparably priced, but not as well spec'd. Very happy thus far; unfortunately, it being January in Maine, not sure when I'll get to ride it next! Will update down the line.

Great bike with good features for the price. If you're just getting into cycling or triathlons, this is a great entry level training/race bike.


Weakness:
Hard saddle, but this can be replaced.


Responsive aluminum frame with carbon fork. Decent wheels (for price). Carbon seatpost. Ultegra derailleur. Bontrager Race crank. Rides stiff and fast. What other bike can give you all this for $900!

Strength:
- Bang for buck: get the 1400 rather than the 1500 and save a few hundred bucks to upgrade the wheels
- efficient power transfer (no perceived flex or whipping around the bottom bracket)
- corners confidently: 63cm frame great for taller guys with more weight
- New 10sp 105 groupset quick, effective and allows easy upgrades (or hand me downs if it ends up a training bike)
- 1/3 price of 5.9SL but more than 1/3 the ride


Weakness:
- 52T chain ring (it deserves a 53T)
- wheel/tire package (no t tried- swapped out immediately based on specs)
- saddle break in takes some time but OK after that

Strictly speaking, I have to rate this a 4 because the weight and ride quality are not as good as carbon but still very acceptable (much better than old Giant TCR2). Will still beat you up more over longer distances or on rougher roads but that's intrinsic of aluminium.


This bike was put together for pure bang for buck and with a few minor upgrades performs sensationally for great value. 

My usual ride is a Madone 5.9SL so I needed something comparable (geometry almost identical) but durable enough to be thrown around without worrying about damaging the carbon frame / paint job (do alot of travelling o/s).

The 1400 with the new 10sp 105 was an easy choice- shifting and feel not DA precise but it is still quick and reliable. A 52T chainring as standard was a bit cheeky so it was swapped for a 53T ultegra and the bike looks and changes 10 gears just like a 1500 for a few hundred less $$$$ (actually I think the darker blue team colour looks better too). 

Handling on smooth surfaces reminds me of my 5.9SL- power transfer is tight and smooth, corners with confidence and general handling is solid (bike store did a great job reproducing the same saddle-pedal-bar geometry so I am probably a bit biased as this makes it feel so similar). It is not until I hit a bump or accelerate hard/climb that the less absorbant and heavier aluminium frame/parts become apparent. However, at one third the price, these are minor issues and certainly not 3 times worse than the more expensive albeit very respectable Madone. Don't get me wrong, the 5.9SL is an awesome bike but the 1400 is much more capable than the one third (or one quarter in stock form) price tag suggests.

Strength:
Comfortable, fast, and some Ultegra for cheap.


Weakness:
Saddle will kill you after 5+ hours. Need to buy better pedals too.


Avid MTB rider...not used to hitting 20+mph easily. Bought this bike (2006 Model) after registering for a 175 mile ride....love it! Looking at Felt but after researching $'s vs. bang (not to mention Trek 8500 MTB is my baby), stuck to brand loyalty. I'm 6'5 215lbs and never thought that this bike could hold up. Course was tough, hammered the gears, hit pot holes, and never let up. This bike was worth every dollar. If you are looking for a great intro road bike that will last with a couple of upgrades if you CHOOSE to make them, worth the money. Looking at the 1000 and 1200...spend the x-tra $ to get the better bike. Would have been dream beginner road bike with better pedals.

Strength:
Strong Aluminum Frame for a big guy. The bike really fits me well.


Weakness:
The stock Bontrager Parts that come with Trek. You have to get into Race XX Lite if you want something decent and that is Thousands of Dolars.


I purchased this 2004-1500 from a poor kid who only rode it once. Immediately I changed out the following: Seatpost, saddle, FD, Crankset, Wheelset, Tires, Bottom bracket. I replaced the stock with the following: 6603 Ult Cranks, Dura Ace 7800 BB and FD, Supergo Carbon Seatpost, Selle San Marco Race gel, Ritchey Pro DS OCR Wheels, Conti Gatorskins, Crank Bros. pedals and today bought new 6600 Ultegra BS. I have now spent over 435.00 in new parts to make this Frameset completely rideable. Let me say this, it climbs and is responsive, it rolls up quickly to speed, it is solid for a guy of 205 lbs, and it is extremly fast. I am in total $$ now just at 1200 dollars and am completely ecstatic with my winter ride. I have put on 500 miles in the last three weeks.

Strength:
Beautiful looking bike that rides like a dream. 105 components.


Weakness:
Generic alloy brakes.


I purchased this bike instead of upgrading my 2003 Trek 1000, which I have also reviewed. This bike is great for my ego. Not only does it look fantastic, but it performs like nothing I've ever ridden. It's really put joy into rides that used to be a lot of work. 

People have said that the 105 rear was a problem for them, but I've never had an issue. The only beef I have is with the generic alloy brakes that Trek uses. They flex when applied, the pads leave gunk on your rims, and they get knocked out of line too easily. They also seem to do a poor job of stopping. I quickly replaced them with a set of 105s.

The ride is glass smooth, it accellerates well, corners great. I know that any fault with my riding is due to the rider, not the bike. 

I have had an issue with a decal peeling from the inside of the left chainstay. I'm hoping to get it replaced under warranty.

I would recommend this to anyone that wants a good quality road bike.

Strength:
Nice paint job (typical taiwanese), Discovery channel colors, Bontrager race lite stem, Bontrager Race fork. Very easy to make it look like a Discovery Channel team bike


Weakness:
Long chainstays! Understeers. Seat angle (75 deg) not comfortable. Value not commensurate to cost.


I bought the 2006 Trek 1500 (discovery team color) size 52 frameset. It has the Bontrager Race fork. It rides quite well although I still have to get the right ""feel"". The bike understeers because of the long wheelbase. The chainstay length is 41.7cm for all sizes. Hence, the 52cm bike's chainstay is unreasonably long and it does not look ""racy"". I hope Trek makes the chainstay length proportional for its size. The seat angle is steep at 75 deg. My butt aches despite the carbon seatpost. Frameset is expensive at $500. I'm selling this bike.

Strength:
1)Seems to be exceedingly adept at passing bikes 3-5 times the price, most notably Litespeed Blades. 2)SLR aluminum/Geometry is very responsive and stiff for thrilling climbing/descending 3)Merely glimpsing the paint job excites you to the point of entering any and all centuries/ironman distance events 4)Quality to win races without the price to ruin marriages


Weakness:
1)Replace rear tire with $30 Bontrager Race Select 2)Upgrade to clipless pedals 3)Can't place near bed or, trust me, you WON'T sleep at night 4)Results in an excessive amount of cold showers 
5)Induces Chronic Delusions of Lance-like Granduer


Purchased Stock and outfitted with tri specific componentry, most notably Profile Design Aerobars and Look 3.1 clipless pedals. ""She"" has outperformed all of my expectations. The price allows the rider to obtain a relatively inexpensive, high performance road bike that could easily lead to multiple podium finishes. All of the ""Trek-specific"" features, such as A-shaped seatstays and custom-butted SLR aluminum, compound upon each other to create an amazing bike. If one was to upgrade to a full Ultegra drivetrain and then compare it to the Madone, the Madone would win, but there would still be some debate. Also, FIT is the MOST IMPORTANT factor. If this bike fits you, run screaming to the nearest dealer and buy it.

Strength:
Nice frame, nice looks, and overall a nice package. If people pass me, it's not the bikes fault!!


Weakness:
Well, there really weren't any, but I must say that after about 1500 miles the Bontrager select tires (rear) was wearing and started flatting. Maybe this is a normal lifespan for a rear tire, but the tread compound seemed a bit soft. But this is nitpicking. Stock pedals with toe clips are outdated.


This review is for a 54cm 2004 model with a triple creankset. This bike is the best for the money! It's not the absolute best bike by any means, but unless you are awfully serious about cycling, or have a ton of money to burn this bike will do a fine job. It's a good climber, it's pretty light, it looks good, and the geometry is relaxed enough to give a decent ride for an all aluminum bike.

Strength:
Solid Frame. Carbon Fiber fork and seat post. Great climber.


Weakness:
Brake Pads.


After a 10 year absence from riding, I decided to get back into it. I checked with several LBS's and everyone had a few different bikes they recomended. The one bike in common was the 1500. I have put about 500 miles on in the last 3 months and love this bike. I am able to keep up with friends on bikes costing 2 and 3 times as much. The frame is stiff when climbing and the combination of the carbon fiber seat post and forks make for a very smooth ride. I tested other bikes of simular price and nothing compared to this bike. I only have a few complaints about this bike...1) I should have waited a little longer. The bikes the LBS are getting in now have an Ultegra rear derailer (mine came with the 105). I took one out and it is a smoother transition. 2) The brakes suck. To be more specific, the brake pads suck. I spent $20 on some kool stop pads. What a difference. This is a must for anybody buying this bike. You will not believe the difference. 3) The tires. I put about 250 miles on them without any problems but decided to switch them out as a test. I thew on some Michelin Pro Race 2 (700 x 23). Huge difference. I am now using the original Selects on training rides but when it counts (when riding with my cocky buddys with $2000-$3000 bikes), I through the Pro Race 2's on and blow them away.

Strength:
Very stiff. It's great to be able to feel every pedal stroke, knowing that your hard work is paying off.


Weakness:
*****After about 200 miles, my front rim began to get 'spoke creak' (as described by the LBS). The shop put on a new wheel from a display bike and I was off and riding again. After about 300 miles, the front wheel has begun to 'creak' again. This occurs when I'm standing up, climbing & rocking the bike back and forth. It seems to get worse w/time. The bike store currently has the wheel and is contacting trek/bontrager to see what can be done. Upon inspection of the front rim, the dealer also found the front hub was turning very roughly, not as smooth as it should be. I'm riding on a Rolf rim the LBS gave me as a loaner. I'm 6' +/- 200 lbs. The LBS said weight should have nothing to do w/it, but i'm begginint to wonder. Will update on how this gets resolved.

Tires are decent, but I upgraded them after about 600 miles. Saddle is really plush, but heavy. (also upgraded)


I love the feel of this bike. The bike seemed to be a better fit over the FELT, SPECIALIZED, and GIANT models that are offered this year.

It's been close to 10 years since I last rode on a consistent basis. I decided to start riding again earlier this year. I wasn't exactly sure what I was looking for in a bike. After a few weeks of shopping around, I decided to buy the Trek 1500. Every sales person at all of the different bike shop's said the same thing about this bike. ""Best bike on the market for the price"". I've changed out the saddle and the pedals. I may also make a few more changes to the bike. Bottom line, I love this bike. I highly recommend the bike to anyone who's looking at getting into riding. It's a fun ride.

Weakness:
None.


Thanks to RBV.com for all the informative postings; they were vital in my purchase. I got a bonus this year and rather than buy something sensible, I thought another bike was just the ticket. With Lance winning is 7th Tour de France, I decided to check out Treks. While I looked at several Trek models in the $400-600 range, the 1500 was such a great value for the money ($919 on sale) that I couldn't resist. Plus the white/blue with red accents paint job was stunning. This particular bike even had an Ultegra rear derailler. The LBS manager upgraded the no-name brakes to Shimano 105s for only $61 more so the entire bike is at least 105. I also liked the triple cranks as I passed age 50 several years ago and want my knees to continue working. The ride is very smooth with the Bontrager Select tires which have been derided in previous posts. I went on a club ride Sunday and led the ""A"" group for quite a while. I even got excited on a climb and passed everyone! What a bike!

For the price you will probably not find a better equiped bike, solid 105 and Bontrager components. Especially a name brand. Trust me I looked.

The triple chain ring is ackward and no name breaks(however they are functioning fine). A double chain ring will be the first upgrade.


I searched for a long time looking for a well equiped bike in this price range. This bike met the criteria. So far the bike out performs the rider and it is great fun learning more and more every ride. No problems or hassles with the bike. The more I ride the happier I am with the purchase. A great platform to grow on.

Tiagra front derailleur is quirky. I understand triples can be fussy but I haven't used the granny gear and this derailleur will sometimes have trouble switching between the two larger chainrings. I'll either swap it out for a Ultegra or covert the bike to a double next year.


Very nice bike for the money. Opted for the 2004 over the 2005 to get the better derailleur and because I preferred the color. Would have been nice to get this in a double rather than the triple but that's a minor quibble.
Seat was comfortable from the start which is very unusual.
The ride is firm without being too harsh. Long rides are a breeze. Bike handles great and could probably be improved with different rubber.
I shopped around quite a while before buying this bike and I really think that it was the best bike for the money.

Great ride for the price. Chose the 04 vs. the 05 for Ultegra rear derailleur. Shop also advised this was one of the last Wisconsin produced framesets. Smooth handling and pleasant ride, nice build quality and upgradeable. Even love the saddle! (This is one of the few bikes I have purchased that I didn't immediately toss the saddle.)

This is a well balanced bike. Handles quickly but not twitchy, stiff but not harsh, and the 105 group works fine. Well put together, no sloppy assembly issues. Light and fast. Probably the best bang for the buck out there. I shopped quite a while, and asked alot of questions, and this kept being refered to as the best all round value going.

Wheels, components, seat post, fork


Weakness:
Pedals


Let me start by saying that I truely love this bike. It is my first road bike, so perhaps I have nothing better to compare it to.

The Trek website has the MSRP of this bike listed at $1,099, so I was very happy to get it for $1,000 (minus $30 for taking it right off of the show room).

Right from the start, the paint job really grabs your attention. I have the red, white and blue model.

I had test ridden a couple of bikes with Sora components, and in hindsight I am extremely glad that I paid more money to get the 105 set. The 105 is not perfect, but it does the job nicely.

The triple crankset is OK for me for now, but as I improve, I will probably upgrade to a double.

The pedals were pretty awful, so I upgraded them.

I have taken a few 40-50 mile rides already, and I always feel great afterwards. This bike really fits me well. That is probably because the guys at Spokes, etc. took the time to fit me.

Strength:
The components - eventhough I upgraded mine, the handling, frame geometry and lightness for the price range.


Weakness:
Going back in to find out why I hear a creeking sound when I stand up and put pressure on the handlebars and front wheel.


I am a very particular buyer and it took me three tries to land on the 1500. I started out looking at all the different models in my price range of $800 - $1000. I decided to buy the Trek 1200, but I then ended up going to another store and got a great deal on the R500 Cannondale - $799. I bought it, but soon discovered that the chainring bent a lot under my 6'2"" and 235 pound frame. They tried to fix it without success. They then put me on a 2004 Specialized Allez Elite which they discounted from $1150 to $899. I immediately liked the feel of the bike, or was it the price? But after a few days I noticed the same problem - not a great crankset on that one either. After riding it for a week, I asked them if they would upgrade the crankset to the latest Ultegra double crankset - they said they would for an extra $215. I started to understand why some bikes cost so much more than others - it isn't only the frame -it's the components! To a large the degree, they can be even more important. I went to a racing buddy of mine's home and he advised me that the bike wasn't the right fit for me and strongly reccomended I go to my local Trek dealership where I started out at. He stressed the after service quality, so I went back. I convinced my wife that I need a bike with better components and off I went. What a great store. One of their technicians spent two hours with me fitting me and getting me on the right bike. The other store never bothered to fit me. I ended up on the 1500 which they discounted to $999 and upgraded the crankset to the latest Ultegra double ring as well as the rear DR and changed the front DR to make it work - all for only $110. What a difference it made! All in all I ended up paying $1110, a bit more than I wanted to pay for a bike, but I realized how important it is to have great components. The frame of the 1500 is good enough to go racing with, but the components can do with the upgrade if you want to ride an hour or more a day. I had a Trek 7200 Hybrid on which I did my triathlons before this and now I average at least 5 - 10 mph faster on my 1500. Overall this a great bike in this price range compared to all the bikes I test rode. You get what you pay for and I recommend you upgrade the crankset.

Strength:
The Trek 1500 is a technical advance from the 1988 Schwinn 564 aluminum I've been riding. More speeds and a wider range of gears than my previous Schwinn -- 27 as compared to 14. Nice for the climbs. 

A well matched set of components, the 2005 has a carbon fibre seat post. Nice carbon fibre fork. Frame is comfortable and responsive, nice response when standing for climbs, reasonably stiff without being punishing.

No problems with wheels, but I'm fastidious about not hammering them on road surfaces. Bontrager tires work for me; I'm not racing, but the next set will be lighter. 

This bike is an excellent match for my needs, a light/fast, responsive training bike with nice details, fit/finish at a good price point.


Weakness:
I dislike the federal requirements for saftey reflectors, drop out tabs that prevent easy removal of the front wheel. Removal of these tabs seemingly voids the Trek warranty. 

Brake tension releases don't open the brake pads sufficient to remove the wheel without rubbing the tires. 

I don't have wheel problems, and my dealer says that I won't have wheel problems. And so I wonder about the riders having problems and what they're doing to the wheels to engender them.


First: Hardy Cyclamens is a flowering annual. 
I'm 57, retired, started racing when I was 14. Road bikes have included an Olmo, Frejus, Bob Jackson (all circa 1960's, Schwinn 564 (Alum., 1988) and the Trek 1500.

210 lbs. -- We won't talk about BMI. *G*

This bike is for training/conditioning rides -- 50 miles more or less. I'm not racing, but I expect a reasonable ""racing bike"" handling and performance.

Strength:
Componentry at this price level is excellent. The frame geometry is race-proven, and if it fits you well, go for it.


Weakness:
Alu is still a bit harsh, but then again I came from riding a Reynolds 631 steel MTB steed, so that's not much for comparison. You must get fitted well to this machine to fully utilize it's strengths and minimize the weaknesses.


Overall an excellent choice for anyone at this price point. I got the upgraded Ultegra RD on mine, I think they may have downgraded to a 105 in the current version. The carbon seatpost and oversized controls really do come in handy. The rest of the specs are mostly at least 105 except the generic brakes that mostly do the job fine. I did my research for over 5 months @ around 3-4 hours a day. This is the best of this mix of the various CDales, Specialized, Giant, Felt, etc. I even looked at the SuperGo house brand Scattante but ultimately went for the better warranty with Trek. You get what you pay for!

Strength:
Excellent shifting after the F. der. change.
Good balance and value.
Good geometry
Comfortable ride
Fast wheels
Accommodate a 28cc tire (for heavier guys and wheel durability). Few bikes could handle the wider rubber.
I like the wider handlebars and the triple crank option.


Weakness:
The tires are durable but ride badly.
The wheels don't stay true (at 6'4""/200lbs). Smaller folks will do better with these wheels.


This is a good all around bike. It's frame is suitable for big guys and the WSD is sensible for women. The part selection is well balanced. The ride is neutral, but at first slow to turn (which is probabaly good for novice riders). What makes this bike special is it's versatility. I needed the option of wider tires and gearing as well as better performance. This bike is the most versatile of 2004 performance offerings. I'd recommend it to most.

It is amusing how many mistake this bike for the high-end Treks. After a few minor chnages, this bike will perform pretty close to the highest end.

I love this bike. It handles well, and is stiff when climbing. Plenty of gears to handle the hills. There is some ""road feel"" with this bike, but it is what I like. I upgraded to a carbon fiber seatpost to even out the ride a little bit(which is an upgrade they made for the 2005 model). It makes a 100 mile ride much easier on the hind quarters. Drivetrain has had no problems. The 105 group components are durable and I won't go broke replacing them.

I’ve been struggling for several months to find the “right bike” for my purpose, i.e. fun and fitness at a reasonable price. First went with a hybrid, but after 30 miles I didn’t feel like going further. Went back to trade for a Trek 1200 and happened to notice the 1500 on display. After changing to lighter wheels, I made the trade and couldn’t be happier. No, it’s not a Madone and the frame isn’t carbon. However, if you look at the component set, weight, etc. in comparison to the price, it’s about as good as one can do. Due to Shimano parts shortage, I lucked out and got the Ultegra rear derailleur in place of the 105. I topped it off with a Selle Italia saddle and have done 80 miles in total (everything’s relative) comfort. Great bike for the price.

Strength:
STI shifters are great. I prefer the Shimano setup to my friend's Campy shifters. Heresy but true. Excellent price / quality balance.


Weakness:
Breaks take a little tweaking to keep in form, although they work very well when maintained. Perhaps I should expect this. The brakes are the least expensive component on the bike. I may upgrade to Ultegras this spring.


I bought this when I decided my 14 year old Trek 1000 with downtube shifters wasn't worth upgrading. I hadn't really ridden much in the last 5 yrs, so I didn't want to drop a bundle on a 3-5k carbon frame until I was back in shape and knew I would keep at it. 

While I could quibble with the components, basically this is a reasonable priced, stiff bike that shifts smoothly when I'm digging to get up a hill and is steady when I'm blasting (at least for me) down the other side.

Weight is about 22-23 lbs., including bottle cage and small saddle bag. Not carbon territory, but not too bad. If I want to go lighter, I can either spend a wad of cash, or stop eating donuts.

Now my wife wants one.

Weakness:
Brakes could be better.


I recently returned to cycling after a long layoff. After doing 150/200 miles a week for two months, I decided to treat myself to a new road bike. You can't beat the 1500 for the money (especially if you can get a discount off the $1100 list price). The 2005 has (mostly) 105 components, with Bontrager carbon post and matched spoke wheels. It weighs about 22 pounds in 60 cm size (although I haven't weighed it). On my last century ride, people on carbon and titanium bikes kept coming up and telling me I had a nice bike. I couldn't figure it out, until I realized that red/white/blue paint scheme for 2005 is the same as the recent Madone and 5.9 paint scheme. Whatever.

Initially a great bike for under a grand. Very stiff frame and great components for price. 105 shifters, ultegra rear der, are a nice addition. Thanks for the great deal from the best bike shop in the southeast!

Weakness:
Pedals, but what do you expect for price.
It's not a carbon frame.


This is my first road bike since an old Trek, 10 speed. I upgrade to an ultegra front derailer and added Look CX 6 pedals. I love this bike. I had been using a mountain bike on the road and this is so much better. The shifting in smooth and so is the ride. I this bike has a great set of components for the price. I looked at the Trek 1200 and decided on the 1500 because of the better componet package. The Great Escape where a bought the bike is great and played a great deal in my decision on the bike. 

I have not tried the bike in real mountains yet. After using a mountain bike on some of the mountain roads with its low gearing I'm worried if I'll have the legs for the same climbs on the Trek. After the mountain bike the acceleration on the Trek seems like a rocket.

Strength:
Frame, fork, Ultegra rear, sturdy wheel set, great value


Weakness:
A bit heavy, just over 20 lbs at 58cm (but hey its under a grand), generic brakes,no double offered


With its 2004 model Trek seems to have taken care of most of the problems other reviewers have cited with the 1500 in previous iterations. A carbon fork is a welcome addition, especially when mated to an aluminum frame such as the 1500, as blips in the road surface seem to disappear before being transmitted to rider's hands. A CRZ saddle imported by Bontrager also helps make the ride a bit more enjoyable while aboard.  Just the right amount of flex and good cushioning in the haunches helps prevent saddle soreness.
Pretty nifty are the Bontrager paired spoke wheels. Just 18 well-spaced spokes up front decreases wind resistance, an important feature when battling a head wind. They are pretty rugged too. I just completed a 300+ mile tour from New York City to Boston bringing my mileage total to just under 1000 and have observed no rim damage or significant untruing of the wheels. This is quite a statement considering I ride completely oblivious to potholes until they are under me (then I am usually cursing at them). Such strength does come at a price in terms of weight. Poor climbers will notice the extra circulating mass during their ascents.

Steep ascents, however, are mitigated by the inclusion of a granny gear. The triple gearing with an Ultegra rear derailleur is quite a desirable drivetrain for the recreational cyclist. The Ultegra rear is smooth and precise and the range of a triple makes touring enjoyable. Another feature that tourers will appreciate are the eyelet mounts off the hangars for attaching a rack. However, no gussets are provided above the brakes for attaching the other end of the rack- this is easily remedied by purchasing a clamp kit.

Faster riders obviously will want a double with its higher gearing up front. Unfortunately, no such option is available (at least to me when I was in the market). Instead, I opted for an 11-23 cassette thus giving me a higher a top end. The brake system also needs some attention. After 200 miles I went to Shimano 105’s from the generic brake set that is packaged with the 1500 and was pleasantly surprised at what a simple upgrade can achieve in stopping distances, especially when laden down with panniers.


The Trek 1500 for 2004 has a lot of strengths, most noticeably its hand built aluminum frame that offers a comfortable, confidence-inspiring geometry. There are few areas that need improvement on this bike. It remains an exceptional value at $1000 that offers a recreational rider a lot options- whether it is touring, racing or casual riding.

I had been riding a Trek 4500 Mt. Bike but figured it was time to add a road bike to my arsenal. I shopped several different bikes including a Specialized, Fuji & Lemond at a half dozen different bike stores and liked the Trek the best. They gave me a great deal on the 2004 1500 model. Only $900! So far so good. The bike is smooth, quick and light. Shifting is effortless and cruising at 25mph is a dream. The different ride between the Mt. bike and road bike is amazing. I'm looking forward to conquering many a ride with this new Trek. Great bike, great ride, great price.

My first road bike. It performs well so far. I cannot really compare it to other bikes yet, but I am satisfied with it. The stock Bontrager fork didn't really absorb road vibration as well as I liked, so I replaced it with the Easton EC90 SLX. I got the fork for a very good price through a friend, and it has made the biggest difference. The bike characteristics have improved considerably, especially cornering, as well as road vibration. It really smoothed out the ride. I also didn't like the stock handlebars, so I replaced it with the oversized Deda Newton bars. I use the Italian bend, and it feels much better. The only negative aspect probably would be the brakes. Doesn't really stop as fast as brakes should.

Strength:
Frame quality, wheelset, decent component mix (Ultegra, 105, Tiagra).


Weakness:
Saddle, brakes, pedals


I have always riden hybrids or cross bikes and had been shopping for a road bike for awhile. It seemed to me there was always a gap between the entry-level machines such as Trek's 1000 and the higher-end bikes like the 2300. When I saw the 1500 on Trek's web site in August, I was immediately intrigued. A search of the Penn Cycle site showed 60 and 63 cm frames available, and after fitting assistance from the staff at Penn, I took the 63 for a spin. I liked the bike right away, and found it to be stiff and responsive without being too harsh over bumps. This is my first road bike in many years, so for me it is a quantum leap in performance. I really like the Bontrager Select wheelset as well, they are a nice improvement over wheels on most bikes at this price level.
I did find the seat lacking, and replaced it with Serfas' DD Arroyo.
The no-name brakes were also less than impressive and left a lot of material embedded on the rims, so upgraded to Ultegra.
The bike has made riding more enjoyable, especially uphill (Ravine St. past Legacy Golf up to the water tower, in Faribault). Thanks Trek!

Strength:
Eyelets for fenders & rear rack.Triple crankTrek support/warranteeFull carbon bike at reasonable price/value point.


Weakness:
Routing of rear brake cable places the cable supports exactly where the frame would optimally rest on my car's bike rack...prompting the use of a transport bar (from stem to seat post). Routing the cable along the top of the top tube could be an easy fix for Trek.Stock 25 mm tires don't fit under fenders, need 23 mm tires.Would prefer slightly longer wheelbase/chain stays.


I picked up ""last year's model"" when it was marked down. Eventually, the 9-speed componentry may become an issue if I break something (or wear it out). But I may be able to make use of some Shimano MTB rear componentry. There are two features that lead me to consider this bike; the eyelets, and the triple crank.  I can't do without the front and rear eyelets that allow me to mount fenders and a rear rack for brevets. I had a tough time finding complete carbon frame/fork bikes that offered this incredibly useful feature. Other carbon bikes that I tested were too responsive/twitchy for my longer trips/brevets. In fact, it took me a couple thousand miles before I wasn't over steering/overcorrecting with this new bike.  There have only been a few sustained mountain climbs that were too much for the gearing with the triple crank. Many fellow riders look at my triple crank with envy. This is a FAST bike, and a climber. When my bike with fenders/rack (and trunk bag) shows for group rides, the other riders are suprised that I may drop them on hills, or take turns pulling on the front. This bike has excelled at longer rides. This year's three 400K's and a 600K brevet's most uncomfortable issues were ""hot foot"" (not the fault of the bike). Only one ""quality"" issue in over 5000 miles: Trek replaced the original rear wheel after multiple cracks formed in the rim at the drive-side spokes (eventually one pulled through). This prompted me to have a more ""bomb proof"" back up wheel set made. The stock wheels and 25 mm Bontrager tires give a substantially softer ride for rough surfaced roads. My back up wheels have many more spokes and 23 mm Conti GP tires, and remove any ""mushiness"" that the stock set up might be accused of. I immediately replaced the seat for a Specialized BG that I already knew worked well for me. The paint scheme of naked carbon/black with metalic paint flecks wasn't my first choice, but has grown on me.  If I wasn't afraid of damaging my carbon frame with a wreck, I might be tempted to use it for a race or two.

I purchased a Trek Pilot 5.0 in March and have been very pleased with my purchase. I would describe myself as a new enthusiast to cycling and enjoy metric century charity, club and training/workout rides. I was looking for a comfortable performance oriented road bike and chose the Pilot over the Trek Madone, Specialized Tarmac and Roubaix. The Pilot's geometry made it comfortable and the OCLV carbon frame was smooth but not mushy ie I still felt very contected to the road. While offering a smooth ride similar to the Pilot the Madone geometry was too aggressive for me. The Tarmac was not as smooth and the Roubaix felt too mushy.The Pilot was the perfect combination of performance, comfort and price with a very attractive paint scheme as well.I have upgraded the stock saddle with a Selle Italia Prolink Gel Flow Light and the stock wheels with Bontrager Race X Lite.

Compared to my old LeMond, I'm in a more upright position and able to accelerate and climb faster, especially with the compact double crank I had installed.

I am constantly amazed at how predictable and smooth (easy on the derrière) this ride is. I've ridden about 700 miles on this bike on mostly acne infested back roads and it is a joy to ride. Enough for the carbon fiber. The other advantage is the upright riding position. Worries over wind resistance are ludicrous unless you are a competitive (read sponsored world class) rider. For the rest of us a nimble, fast, comfortable ride waits in this wonderful machine. Also, mine came with the 105 group and a ultegra rear deraullier. It functions very well and I don't see how spending more on components would improve this bikes performance. I look forward each day to my ride on this bicycle.

The frame reduces a lot of the road vibrations on chip and seal roads. The gears are very quiet and smooth. I have to agree with another internet reviewer who rated this bike a ""buttery ride.""  The more upright position is very comfortable for my middle aged body. I found that I could ride a metric (62 mile) century in just a few weeks.  This is a good bike for those riders who want a comfortable ride with a more upright position.

I waited a while to post this so I've ridden it alot. It is an insanely comfortable bike. I feel more invigorated after 80 miles on it than before I start; like the Energizer bunny - it just keeps going and going. But it is definitely more comfort oriented than performance. Does haven't the same get up and go/responsiveness as my old ""traditional bike"" but at almost 50 years young, riding doesn't hurt anymore. I'm not sure if this is do to the ride position or the triple; which was something I was leary about at first but have to admit I use occasionally (and it helps). I'm hoping to ride the Rockies and will definitely use it there.

This was tough on the old pride, as a multiple double century rider! Anyway, I finally surrendered the speed and jump of my Cannondale crit bike and rode the Madone and the Pilot. Both offered plush ride characteristics, with the Pilot not to far behind the Madone for performance.The Pilot position is definately better if you are dealing with low back issues. I have great expectations of being able to do centuries again, and have begun working toward that goal.I switched out the stem to a 110/10 for personal fit. I am 6'1"" and the 58cm fits.

Haven't found one yet. Changed out the seat and maybe will do so on the brakes, but we'll see how they hold up.


Actually, mine is a 2006. Bought it in late May. I went to the LBS to test ride the Pilot 2.1 just to see if it really felt different than my Trek 1200. They had the same size (54cm) but in the Pilot, it felt too small and compact. I asked them for a 56cm and they didn't have it, but they did have it in the 5.0 model. I rode it just to see how the larger size felt and ended up buying the bike 20 minutes later. Have road it about a couple hundred miles so far and have fell in love with it. We ride on a bunch of seal and pebbel roads in rural NC and this bike absorbes every little bump. The upright stance has made the long rides MUCH easier. The 10 speed cassette raises my cadence on the hills and I get to the top with almost no trouble. Highly recommend this bike for anybody.

Component group. Get rid of the 105 shifters-Dura-ace makes a HUGE difference


I have waited to write a review on this bike until I had enough time in the saddle to give an objective opinion. I love this bike! It is most definitely a climber. I'm not ashamed to be using triple rings. It's nice because you can upgrade cheap to Dura-ace triple stuff that people are getting rid of to go to compact doubles!I'm not the first up the mountain, but I'll get there with plenty left in the tank to take on another climb. Look, I'm not a racer, I never have been. I'm in my 40's, and wanted a bike that I could be comfortable on, yet keep up with the pack. I rode the Specialized Roubaix and the Pilot. The first time I took out the Pilot, I was hooked. I felt right away that I could ride this bike for miles. My only complaint is with the component mix-very strange with 105 shifters and front derailleur, dura-ace rear derailleur, and A550 brakes (note that the brakes are long-reach if you want to upgrade. Shimano makes the 600 series, which is ultegra level). If you go with the 5.0, you're paying for the frame.

Strength:
Weight, Wheels, Comfort. Acceleration when you need it and climbs well. Stable on climbs out of the saddle.


Weakness:
Handle Bars. Bontr. makes better ones. Seat is ok, nothing wrong but not great.


For the over 40 crowd who still is in good shape but want some relief at times, this bike is a winner. Very smooth, and comfortable. Seat and handle bars not my favorite but all else is great. Using it for long rides and some fun races. Dont worry about the triple - ignore the others as some day you will need it! Geo of the bike is great as it does make a difference on long rides. The 105's are good enough as either the Dura Ace or Ultegra on the back end is what matters. This is a great bike for folks who want to ride hard, race occasionally but sill can only get out three times a week.

none to date, will see if brakes hold up but are good for now


Relatively new rider. First bike a Fuji Finest chromalloy-great bike. Pilot however, is like it is just you and the pedals. Very smooth ride, takes bumps and uneven roads extremely well. I have put 300 miles on the bike this season, and the only problem has been adjustments to the chainring cable. Overall, I LOVE this bike, and love the carbon fiber- light yet controllable, great on the road! Also, the geometry is fantastic. I did get it fitted for me at a bike shop experienced in bike fitting. Sitting higher up is great for us middle aged folks ( late 40's and up) who want to put on the miles without back pain.

Strength:
smoth ride, comfortable, responsive


Weakness:
some lower end components like the breaks


I have a 2006 Pilot 5.0 (2006 not an option on the menu yet). Trek must have lowered the price dramatically for 2006 since it was listed at $2399 for 2005. I had a Klein Quantum before and the comfort difference is remarkable. I was tempted to get the 5.2 SPA with the added shock absorber, but it was $2994 at my LBS. The bike has lesser components than you would expect at the price, but then you don't expect to get an all carbon frame at this price either. I have 30,000 miles on my Klein and replaced almost everything, so I can gradually upgrade the 5.0 when needed. Because the 5.0 is a 9-speed, I was able to put an XTR rear derailer on with an 11-32 rear cluster. There are lots of hills where I ride (Oregon), so this was a great advantage over the stock 12-25/Ultegra rear end.

The main thing I want to say is that Trek wanted to make a comfortable performance bike and they suceeded. The chip seal that drove me crazy with my rigid Klein is now mellowed out.

Strength:
- Comfortable bike with anti vibration dampening built in.
- Lifetime warranty on the frame
- More upright position for those long rides


Weakness:
- The component group that comes with the bike is unusual. 105 Shifters, Brakes, and front derailler, Durace Rear Derailler, should of had Ultegra at least instead of 105 for the price. 
- I guess I'll upgrade when I see any sign of wear and tear.


This is my first road bike, so I don't have any point of reference except the time I spend riding my mountain bike. First thing I noticed is how smooth the bike is and how well it handles. 
So far I have about 1,500 Kilometres on the bike and I never really felt sore after a long ride even after my first century ride.
For a ""Comfort Bike"" I was rather surprised how well it accelerated up hills. I guess that's what happens when you spend most of your time on a full suspension mountain bike.

Strength:
Light weight, very stiff and good handling


Weakness:
Bontrager Wheelset is garbage. Shifting with internallly routed cables is very sluggish. Trek unable to supply recall parts.


This is a review of the 2013 Madone 5.2. I purchased this new from my lbs last year. In the past 13 months, the bike has been in the shop for a total of 7 weeks. The first issue was due to sloppy shifting. The rear wouldn't shift smoothly and it appears that the internal cable guides were rubbing. The guys at the shop replaced rear cables and housing and shifting improved slightly. Later, Trek recalled the bike due to a faulty brake design. The LBS instructed me to bring the bike in ASAP and the bike sat more han a month due to a part shortage. Lastly, the rear wheel developed cracks around the spoke nipple and had to be replaced. Lead time for new wheel was 4 weeks. Luckily, the bike shop loaned me a wheel until a replacement arrived.  I'm very frustrated that I dropped 3 large on a bike that has has been less reliable that the 10-year old bike it was replacing. I had always dreamed of having a high-end bike but this one is a real let down. Trek, if you're listening, that swooshing sound is me and anyone within earshot looking for another brand.

Strength:
I don't own this bike, but it appears to be one cool machine. I gave it 4's because there must be better for more money. Why else would they charge $11-12K?


Weakness:
There don't appear to be any. If I had the money, I might buy it.


I'm posting this for the recreational user who believes that by paying more money, he will go faster. Not so. Speed is determined by, weight of the bike, weight of the rider, gearing of the bike, and strength and endurance of the rider. Recently I watched a YouTube comparison of a $650 bike against an $11K bike by Mike Horn. In it he said if you put equal physically fit riders on the two bikes, the $11K carbon fiber bike would be 1.5 miles further down the road after one hour. Put a 50 pound overweight middle aged man on the carbon fiber bike and a fit 25 year old on the $650 bike, and the fit 25 year old could be twice as far down the road on the cheaper bike. However, if you want to compare yourself with other middle aged fat men, yeah, you may be further down the road on the carbon fiber bike, but it might be a bit embarrassing. Who do you think you are? Mike Horn is a guy who rides about 20,000 miles a year. His day to day bike is a $350 Windsor that he's upgraded with better wheels, chainring, and cog. All together he has $650 in it. For that reason, I bought a Forge CTS 1000 from Target.com for $400. It's an average size bike which fits me well. It comes surprisingly well equipped, but I may upgrade the cog and chainring eventually. Weight is not as low as carbon fiber, but it isn't bad. Lastly, the best thing to do to decrease weight is to lose some of your own body weight and add muscle. You will go faster. I'm pushing too much fat now. If I lose 20 pounds, it should make a big difference considering that the gearing isn't a lot different than the Trek Madone 5.2. Oh, and lose some age too. Young people go faster!

Strength:
I, like other reviewers am an older recreational/touring cyclist who decided to do the warp speed conversion to carbon fiber. This bike has made me feel like a 25-year-old kid again! I still can't keep up with the kids, but like others have said, this bike simply urges you to go faster. I've always sought the hills, and the Madone is a dream come true: it begs to climb. I've ridden the bike nearly 2800 miles in four months with an elevation gain of 230K ft. and other than the obligatory 200-300 mile ""new bike"" tuneup, a set of tires, regular chain clean and lube, I haven't touched it. I only hope that my aging body will hold out long enough for me to enjoy riding until I drop.


Weakness:
This is NOT a weakness, but rather the sharing of a simple solution to a ""rattle"" problem. One thing that really impressed me with the Madone was the very cool way the rear brake and rear shifter cables were internalized through the top and downtubes. Several custom framebuilders back in the day did this, and I always admired this touch. I'm pretty anal when it comes to creaks, rattles, and other annoying noises, and I become obsessed with a cure. This bike ""rattled"" when ridden on rough pavement (damned chipseal!!). I investigated the usual suspects: loose headset, brake lever bounce, loose wheel bearings, loose stem/handlebars, etc., all of which were solid, and I finally discovered that it was the rear brake and rear shifter cable housings chattering against the headtube, which they kiss as they wrap around it to their top/downtube insert slots. The simple solution was to cut pieces of moleskin and stick them onto the head tube where the cables contact = no more rattle!


Get on, click in, and RIDE! You won't want to stop.

It's expensive, but, if you can afford it, it's well-worth it.


As my first road bike purchase in 20+ years, I am -exceptionally- happy with my new 2012 Madone 5.2. I've done a bunch of treks on touring bikes, and think it's about time for me to step back into the world of road bikes. I am absolutely astonished at how far the technology has come in the last two decades.  As another reviewer put it, this bike feels as though it's got a hidden motor -- hills that were a slog for me on my old Specialized mountain bike are now a piece of cake; I can pedal about half the revolutions and coast up them if I want to. The bike asks to be ridden fast -- even at 80 rpm cadence, it wants more. I feel as though 99.99% of my pedal energy is being put into forward motion, absolutely amazing. Love it.

Just returned from a 60 miler in the hills of Clermont, Florida after picking up my new Madone 5.2. I purchased the Chi Red/Trek White Madone and replaced the white tape and hoods with black. I upgraded to a Fi'zi:k Aliante saddle and Race X Lite wheels.  Awesome looking bike!! The Madone exceeded my expections with climbing eagerness and the desire the be ridden fast. The carbon frame provided a smooth ride, yet a responsive ride. The 50-34 crank and the 11-28 cassette with the Shimano Ultegra components make a perfect combination for smooth climbing and fast riding. Brian and John Paul at Cycling Hub in Clermont, FL did an awesome job setting up the bike and fitting me for my new riding partner...The Madone! Ride Hard.....

Weakness:

I upgraded from a 2006 Trek Pilot 5.0 (carbon frame, ultegra crank and shifters) triple crank. First, I was concerned I would lose climbing ability going from a triple to compact crank. My wife is a VERY strong rider and I would always lose a lot of ground to her on steep hills. Not the case with the 2012 Madone 5.2. After 250 miles and some good hills I find this bike to be a climbing machine. I've been right with my wife on steep climbs. I also love the compact crank. I found that I seldom went to my big crank on downhill routes with my old triple crank.  The gears shift smoothly and quietly. Breaks are very responsive. The bike seems much lighter than my old Pilot. I also wanted a bike with internal cabling and Trek got it right with this design. I purchased the carbon/smoke color and I think the bike looks awesome. I like the sight of the raw carbon.  My early review of this bike is very high. I think the price of the bike is very reasonable when you look closely at the quality of the frame and components. I recommend the bike for serious recreational riders. On most weeks, I ride between 100-200 miles a week.

This is a 'first ride' review of a new 2011 Madone 5.2 Ultegra. Instant acceleration from wide down tube and BB90H2 frame makes this bike comfortable for a recreational rider.Internal cables and Duo Trap sensor gives clean lines and I love the compatibility with my Edge 500Strong brakingFront chain wheel carbon ramp gives instant upshiftSuperb handling


Weakness:
None that I can detect yet


The bike feels weightless - by which I mean that it responds instantly to the riders power input. I am an 'older' recreational rider but in spite of the probable body flexibility of a brick and the core strength of a jelly, Hendry Cycles in Ocean Grove have fitted me so perfectly to this H2 frame that I am perfectly balanced between saddle, pedals and bars. There is very little pressure on my hands and I can lift them from the bars without falling forward. I've owned an Avanti a Felt and an Orbea Onix and none of those bikes ever felt as comfortable as this Trek.  I wouldn't class myself as having good bike handling skills, but on my first ride I got on the drops and pedalled flat out down a 6% gradient, reaching about 58 kph. The bike tracked as if on rails and I didn't feel any nervousness. Near home I gently took my hands off the bars and this bike just flowed on in a straight line.  I was riding with a small group of experienced roadies of a similar age (most 20 years younger!) and there were literally exclamations of astonishment when I sprinted past them on a short climb. The bike feels as if it's got a hidden motor. The brakes stop the bike quickly. The Ultegra groupo changes gears quietly and quickly with particular praise for the carbon ramped front chain wheel. Touch the shifter to change up and instantly and silently the chain is on the big wheel. Probably because of the excellent fit, I felt settled on the saddle. Some owners don't like the stock saddle but our rear ends come in different sizes and weights and saddle preference is very individual.  It's impossible for me to rate the Bontrager wheels without direct comparisons, except to say that as the bike shoots up hills like a pip out of a lemon, I don't think the wheels are letting the bike down. The bike wouldn't track and climb as well as it does if the wheels weren't doing a good job.  This is a superb bike built for speed and comfort and suitable for any enthusiastic rider who prefers a slightly more relaxed riding position. It's perfect for weekend warriors and organised rides.  Someone said that cycling is the most fun you can have without laying down. It certainly is on this bike.

Wheels, but they aren't the worse ones that I've seen.


I have heard a lot of people talk about the BB and all the Bontrager as being poor quality but I have had no problems. I have just over 3,000 miles in since January and I haven't replaced anything on the bike. I will replace the wheels once I can convince my wife that I need to spend another grand on this bike (which will take a lot of convincing). I have had a blast on this bike and hope to for years to come.

Strength:
LightStiff


Weakness:
Poor Customer ServiceCheap WheelsetMade in TaiwanBontrager Components


The stock seat post would not go low enough for the bike to fit me properly. Trek denied the request when the bike dealer asked Trek if I could swap for a shorter seat post. So,I had to pay 85.00 for a new post after already paying 3600.00 for a bike made in Taiwan! Very poor customer service especially considering the price of the bike. How hard would it be for Trek to give customers the option choosing a minimum seat post height prior to purchase, especially when buying a higher end model? It was very disheartening to look down and see the ""Made in Taiwan"" sticker after paying a premium price for what I assumed was for American labor. Had I know in advance I was, not paying for American labor or customer service, but simply for the Trek name, I would have just bought a very comparable Specialized Roubix(also made in Taiwan) for significant less $$$$$! Furthermore, had to immediately change the stock wheel-set. The Bontrager Race are pretty much junk and just was slow the bike down. Switched to ROL Volant

Strength:
Looks great. Very smooth.


Weakness:
All the bontrager stuff. The seat post angle and the fitting.


I liked it but an expert didn't. Putting aside that I had a crap fitting at the trek store which is hard to do. I had to pay nearly 700 more to correct the seat, change the saddle. Get proper fitted handlebars and I need new cranks which were given to me with the wrong size. Load of crap from lbs. I love the bike itself. Well motly. The wheels are poor and I changed those for some dt Swiss 1250's which helped a lot. When I got a true professional fitting the gist of it was that I should be more picky next time and get a different bike. I trust the guy that fitted it more than the lbs so maybe I'll look around in a couple of years. Having said that the bike is now a great ride. Fast. Pretty. Stiff. Good on hills. Descents. Corners. Long flats. Obviously thisis partly the result of 3000 dollars of changes but if you buy the bike think about removing everything from bontrager and I think you can end up with a good bike. Just cause the frame is good and the group set is ok. The bontrager stuff feels a bit cheaper and lets the bike down. The upgrades have made the bike better than most on the road. Especially in the hills.

Fellow Road RidersI was shocked when TREK wouldn't repalce my Madone 5.2 frame after all of the issues it has. BB had worn and new bearing sets would fall out after being installed. Frame had linear indications and TREK offered to cut the frame up and repalce it if there were actually cracks or if no cracks I would just be frameless! Trek shops are great but the warranty process is slow with no results. I'm a fairly high mileage ride probably 7,500 per year and TREK frames just can't keep up. Sorry for TREK in San Diego.

Bontrager Race wheels are heavy and don't have good track record for reliability


I have a 2006 Madone 5.2 and was in a position to purchase a 2011 Madone 5.2 through the Trek friends and family deal a friend of mine gets for racing for a trek sponsored team. Even though the 2011 is made in Taiwan and not OCLV the difference in technology of the frame design is incredible. I'm 6'2 weigh 185 and the 2011 is stiffer than the 2006. The bottom bracket is 90mm and extremely stiff. I notice zero flex in the frame. The bike is 3/4 pounds lighter and screams down the descents. I think Trek makes the best bike for the masses and this one is a home run.

Strength:
While the bike worked as advertised it was a fair all around bike.


Weakness:
Trek appears to be putting more effort into avoiding valid warranty issues than focusing on the customer service that made them successful to begin with.


!!!!HEY!!!!! Madone owners are you feeling like your crank isn't quite as stiff as it once was? Well your not alone!!! That's because Trek has a design and or manufacturing flaw with the 2008/09 madones where the carbon fiber bottom bracket socket that holds the bearings wears out and the bearings are no longer able to seat snugly. Trek's fix is to hammer a over-sized bearing ""known as the V2 bearing"". Their is a whole forum post on this site that goes into why this is a crappy fix ""I use the term fix loosely as this is really a patch"" as I guess they are hoping you will crash or sell the bike in the time it takes to wear the socket out again.

Strength:
Frame is rigid and light and comfortable. No compromises at all in any area. For the money, I don't think you can get a better frame/drivetrain/wheelset out there.


Weakness:
The Ultegra setup leaves me a little underwhelemed...In certain gear combos, it just won't trim out. The 28 tooth gear is unusuable in the the big sprocket up front. I realize I should use this crossover gearing, but it would be nice if it would actually shift into that gear.


Drop down wouldn't allow 2011 in model year. This review is for a 2011 Madone 5.2. After significant hassle with the manufacturer trying to get a replacement for a failed steerer tube (and subsequent, ugly crash), they finally relented and did the right thing. They didn't have another 2009 4.7, so they offered a 2011 5.2. After the year this mess took, I was ready to sue. I picked up the 5.2 replacement yesterday. After 1 mile on this bike, all was forgiven. I love the bike. The ride is crisp and peppy. You push the pedals and there's no bs from the bike. It goes. Moreover, it's comfortable, even without a professional setup. This may be the first bike I've owned where I am truly the limiting factor in the whole setup. I think it's faster than I am or will ever be. This was going to be my backup bike to my S-Works SL2 Roubaix. I'm afraid S-Works will become the backup. Today, I went my standard 38 mile loop in about my usual time (2.5 hours), but my average heartrate was about 3 points lower than normal...All else equal, I can only attribute it to the bike. It really does make the road eaiser to pedal on.

In the shop again 5th time for broken rear spoke on the outer side. Just took it back for the Trek Rep to look at, Hopfuly E Prov Cycle will replace and stand behine the product and replace the rear wheele Sloppy free wheel has locked the chain and thrown it off back and.

Weakness:
The Bontrager saddle felt like an up-side-down bar stool. The Bontrager breaks feel a little light.


I recently pick up a 2009 Trak Madone 5.2 Pro. Awesome.i upgraded from a Kona Zing with 105 Shimano and a carbon fork. My Madone has a SRAM Force groupo. i loved my old bike, but the difference between a $1400 bike and a $4000 ($3000 cause of 2009 model) bike is crazy. At first i found the Trek a stiff twitchy ride that only took 2 outings to get used to. The SRAM Force compared to the 105 is like Napoleon Dynamite vs Rocky. Crisp shifting! Long road rides are comfy except for the saddle which I switched out for my old Selle seat. I can't say enough about this ride.

Weakness:
Wheelset durability?


2009 Madone 5.2, Sweet ride, switched from my Cannondale Alum CAAD 5, after all the carbon hype I think I was expecting a ride like my Anthem 0 full suspension MTB. I did notice a difference with the carbon frame, stiff and responsive. It does seem to ride smooth. Climbs like a scalded cat. I hardly ever stand when climbing with this bike. Now I did have a standard crank on my old bike and I am now running the compact setup with the Madone. My only concern with this rig is the wheelset. I have herd terrible things about the RaceLite wheelsets. From what I understand problems were with the pre 2008 stuff. I have used my Mavic Kyserium Equipes for years with no need to true. The Trek guy assured me these wheels are good, stay tuned. The Ultegra stuff shifts when I push and slows me down when I pull. Seems no better than my reliable 105 but looks nice in grey.

I actually purchased my bike in Nay of 2009. I loved the bike but I have had the frame replaced twice because there has been a crack in the Chain Stay. The first time it was underneath on the right side. it was a retangular shape. I had trouble getting them to replace the bike but they did finally. Shortly after getting the new frame, it develped another crack in the chain stay this time it was a vertical crack in the middle of the chain stay. The factory claimed that it was an impact fracture but there was never anything that touched that bike much less hit it hard enough to break it. They weren't going to replace it this time until I threatened to send out a blog with pictures. The owner of the store called me back and told me that the outside sales rep decided he would replace it out of the goodness of his heart but that if it happened again he would not replace it. So my question is; is any one else had a problem with the Madone 5.2. I loved the bike but I can't afford to take a chance on this bike if it breaks again I'll be out of riding. I love the bike it has been great except for the cracks. I can't rate it any higher than a 3 because of that. Really If they aren't going to back up the product I should rate it a 1.

Strength:
Stiff, awesome acceleration, great climber! It's obvious why Contador rides this one.


Weakness:
1. VERY stiff ride, almost like my aluminum. Although the Carbon is supposed to provide a little more supple ride, the bladed spoke with lacing on the Bontrager wheels is likely the reason for the excessive stiffness. The weakness is, however, overshadowed by the excessively CRISP handling and overall performance. 2. Also, the Dura-Ace 7800 10-speed triple is finicky. If your not an experienced shifter, you'll be frustrated. 3. The new seat ""mast"" is a pain to use if you remove your seat to get the bike in the car often.

Strength:
Climbing, cornering, long rides, short rides, sprints, it does it all, looks great too!


Weakness:
1  1)I'm not sure I'm sold on the Ultgra drivetrain. No major complaints but not a real noticable difference to the 105 components either. 2)The rear derailer cable routes through the frame behind the bottom bracket and it collects every bit of road grime, sports drink etc and can bind up the shifting. I'm not the worlds best when it comes to keeping my bike clean but this guide requires continuous cleaning. 3) The paint on the bottom of the down tube chips readily. Minor stuff really.


I've been riding my 2009 5.2 Pro since March, about 8 months. My previous ride was a 2007 Trek 1500 triple. The 5.2 is an amazing ride. Very comfortable, very fast, but I love how I climb on it. I went with a 53/39 up front and an 11/25 cassette and really thought I'd have to work on my climbing but the bike motors up hills like a dream, sitting or standing. I'm actually climbing in higher gears than before. I know the motor makes the difference but this bike feels like part of my body. I'm also going into corners lower and faster than ever before. It is sure footed and responsive. I upgraded to the raceXlite wheels with white spokes. They're true and smooth and look great too.

Weight, frame geometry, solid built, beautiful paint job (Discovery colors). Attracts lots of looks and comments.


Weakness:
The stock groupset Shimano Ultegra STI with rear DuraAce derrillieur works fine but has required a lot of tuning. The mechanics tell me it is my riding. Had to raplace the chain at 2000 miles. This third tune up by City Bikes mechanics -- they are the best -- finally did it, I hope.


Fourth road bike in two years. This one finally did it. I'm and older guy who has found cycling an addiction. Has changed my life. The SL 5.2 does it all well. It is light, tight and a great climber. It gave me the ability to climb the Rickenbacker causeway bridge without huffng and puffing. I must say that I test rode a Giant a couple of weeks ago with a SRAM set and it was smoother, faster and the gears were slicker and seamless. So, I love my Madone, but I've already cheated on her once!

Weakness:
Atracts attention.Dura Ace whould be nice.


Everyday I ride this bike 20 miles to work and back and felt it was time for a review.  After road riding in the 70s and 80s (google Mondia bikes) and then switching to mountain bikes in the 90s (barracuda crmly), I started commuting again three years ago. With my advanced age I needed all the techno help I could get short of burning fossil fuels. So we decided on an all carbon bike for the light weight and cushy ride. More than once I looked down after riding over a bump to see if I have enough air in the tires, when in fact, it is just a smooth riding bike. Yet fast. And fun. And I get a lot of ""How much was that bike?"" When that happens I just show three fingers.  But true to my former mountain bike form I ride off curbs, cut through grass, and jump ocassional speed bumps. The wheels are holding up with all the abuse but the original rear tire got seashelled. Every now and then when there is a wind storm, sand blows up on the bike path which I think is great fun. Especially if there is a sign that says ""bike path closed."" You have to blast through the drifts and if the sand is not too deep you can make it. One would guess that 4"" to 5"" is the maximum sand depth over concrete for riding a road bike.  So with all that abuse it would not be too surprising to know that after a while some sort of horrible groaning was comming out of the drive train. Moreover the bike was really dirty with grime and sand and whatever. I was too embarassed to bring it to the local shop in such a state, and when my wife complained about the car being dirty I said ""if anything is getting a washing its the bike!"" After the bike bath, the weird sounds went away, and the bike shop gurus said that it was the rollers that can make the sounds. Well maybe if I had known that I would have just shot them them with some WD40. But it was good to wash all that excess sand away, and I swear its even faster when clean and shiny. Anyway its a great bike.

Reviewing the 2008 Trek Madone 5.2 Pro. Moved up from a steel (Reynolds 853) Lemond. This bike accelerates much better and is also much better at absorbing road vibration. Seems more confident on descents and corners also. I am definitely riding faster and it is much easier to stay with a group. I'm also not nearly as tired at the end of a ride and my back doesn't get so stiff and sore. The bike weighed 17 lbs. with Bontrager Race X Lite wheels, cages, and Dura Ace pedals. If you live anywhere near Lakeland Florida go the Trek store there. The staff is great !

Strength:
Frame - climbing, comfort.


Weakness:
Ulegra SL


2008 Trek Madone 5.2: Purchased at Scott's Cycles in Salem, OR in July 2007. Scott's customer service is outstanding; good people. The bike frame? Unbelievably light and responsive for climbing and scarily fast on the descents - just a rocket. Components? Ulegra SL - NEVER AGAIN. In the shop a half a dozen times for adjustments. Sloppy free wheel has locked the chain and thrown it off back and front several times; needed tightening after I detected subtle clunking sound in frame. Frankly, the Shimano Tiagra on my 2000 Lemond Tourmalet (now my commuter bike) performed better. I expected more for what I paid. Would buy Trek again, but nothing less than Dura Ace. Rating: B

Weakness:
The white seat and handlebar tape shows dirt very quickly.


Actually, I have the 2008 model and IT ROCKS!!! Once I got it dialed in, it became an absolute rocket. I always thought that my 5200 was a very light bike, but when I got on this one I was blown away. The balance is so precise, it feels like it responds to thought instead of touch. I love the integrated seatpost and the Shimano components. It climbs like a goat and screams on flats.

From my perspective regarding the actual ride, there's no difference with this Madone 5.2 and my previous bikes. I still got tired going up the hill and I still got passed up by other riders. I just wanted a new bike with the latest technology. I waited over 8 years for Trek to come up with the integrated headset.

I’ll start by saying that these, and all previous carbon bikes from Trek are absolutely great frames to ride. Light, nimble, suck up road vibrations like no other...really top not stuff. They always look pretty slick too. The only issue, which has been an issue with Trek carbon bikes for over a decade, is the paint cracking. Rather than find a remedy for the problem, Trek now warrantees paint for one year...so, after 6 months on my latest frame, I now have to spend two months without it while it gets repainted or replaced – after all, once the paint cracks there is no way to know if it is just paint of if the frame has cracked. I have been through this before, and have always been GURANTEED by the sales rep that it was just paint. Well, 3 out of the 4 times this has happened it was indeed a cracked frame. Of course, I only found this out after INSISTING it be sent back to Trek, at my own expense of course. This is a major safety issue that Trek doesn't seem to want to correct. This is my 4th carbon frame from Trek...I'm tired of this never ending cycle of replacements. I’m not saying don’t buy one, but inspect you paint constantly. My experience has been that when the paint it cracked, it is a sign of a bigger problem. Insist that your local bike shop send it back – trust me they will tell you it is just paint and to forget about it. I used to sell these bikes and this is what we were told to do by Trek.

Strength:
Good quality build and finishLight (54cm performance with super-light pedals and computer: 16.7lbs).Fast


Weakness:
None yet that I know of, just be sure to get the right fit. the only weakness is i can't ride it all the time.


This is the 2008 Madone 5.2. I spent weeks researching and considering the Madone, Cervelo R3, and others. The trek was the one because I got a good price on it, trek has a great warranty/customer service, and it was only a couple pounds heavier than a Cervelo which is a grand more.  I ride a mountain bike every day for commuting so I bought this with a computer (cateye v2c) and Look Keo carbon/Ti pedals, in total it weighed at 16.7lbs.  This is my first ever road bike, first time with clip-in pedals. So riding it from the shop was a great experience, yes the frame is as stiff as could be, its very light, all high quality parts/finish, a stiff but smooth ride. Brakes were great, max speed i've had is 39mph on my first ride. The bontrager wheels actually seemed decent, good enough for most needs. I went over some broken glass in the road, only a couple bits and the tyres are fine. The groupset it good i think, can't compare it to anything, but it does the job very well, I like the ultegra. It stops in a blink.  I'm 5""6ish, and for the Cervelo I was quoted to get a 50cm frame, the giant would have been about a 50cm frame, for this Madone 5.2 Performance compact that I went for, it was a 54cm, and it fits perfectly.  Personally I wouldn't ride in just lycra, or that, I wear padded shorts under trousers, but forget about wind resistance, people wear lycra to look trendy. If you're not going fast enough, pedal harder. Unless you're racing. I bought this bike for weekends and a couple times in the week, its amazing.

Trek upgraded my 5200, that had a frame problem, to aMadone 5.2 frame, painted it the color I wanted and the shop upgraded the drivetrain to Dura Ace and Shimano compact. Additionally, I upgraded the 105 brakes from the 5200 to the Cane Creek 5.2 model. The whole bike is stiffer, faster and stops very well even with my 195 pounds on board. I ride 100 - 200 miles a week and now have 2100 miles logged on this frame. It's been a great bike. Thank you Trek.

What a great bike! Just picked it up a couple weeks ago. Been riding bicycles for 32 years. Raced BMX as a kid. Some road riding and mountain biking when I lived in Colorado. But, up until I bought this bike a month ago, I never thought of going more than 5 miles on anything without an engine. Within a week of buying this bike I was doing 30 and 40 mile rides and still wanting more. The hills of western NJ and PA are no problems for this bike, even considering I am the weak link in the equation.

Weakness:
The tires and seat may not work for everyone.


Just put 500 miles on this beauty and feel I can now comment. This bike is very fast, climbs beautifully, and the componentry for me is top notch. Anyone that says Trek's feel dead are fools. It absorbs alot of fatigue inducing vibration and shocks. Just ebayed my Colnago Master for this. The Trek allows me to generate much more power due the the geometry and lighter weight. My model is a red 5.2SL, gorgeous paint job imho, even compared to the Colnago. Ultegra/Dura Ace mix is a home run. Tires suck. Just put on Vredestein Fortezza Tricomps.Seat did not work for me. Switched to my trusted Selle Trams AM Gel Lite. Mine came with 175mm cranks, took me a little to get used to, but the power and leverage are already strengthening my legs: I like it now.I would recommend this bike to anyone that wants to get a great bike at a reasonable price. Riding is a great hobby for me and I push a hard and train hard.I feel I have a long way to go to get to where this bike can take me performance-wise and that is a great thing!

Strength:
Very stiff, well built, reasonable weight, handles nicely, climbs well


Weakness:
Surprisingly harsh ride for a carbon bike, dimensions may not work well for many people.


First - an excellently designed bicycle. Trek has created a winner for many.It is a great bike for building a Tri or TT bike. The dimensions work very well for aero-bars.However,if you are primarily a road cyclist/racer be sure to pay close attention to the the frame angles. For me, It's impossible to get a correct fit - and I'm not built unusually. I've tried for months and still no success. Since I've raced for over a decade, I have my needs very well established. What happens, is that I can not get my knee where I want it - centered to a bit forward of the pedal spindle. If I use the LeMonde postion (knee behind the pedal spindle)it will work, but I lose power. That's because the top tube is a bit short. It scrunches me up when placing my knee where I want it - even with a LONG stem. The net result is that on longer races, I tend to cramp up. I once owned another Trek and had the exact same problem. It is never an issue on, for example, any Italian designed frame or even my last bike - a Giant TCR.So, dispite the fact that it IS a great bike, I'm replacing the frame with a Giant TCR.

I didn't want to review until I put some miles on the new ride. this bike is incredible. After trying out many bikes in about 5 stores, this one was by far the best. I was in a price range and even found a Project one, but this felt the same and the Madone 5.2 was cheaper by 500.00 I changed out the seat to a Selle Italia SLR Gel and Speedplay pedals.Ultegra shifts crisp and smooth. The madone 5.2 really wants to climb hills and go fast, it literally takes off from underneath you. It is light even when stock, but you get it lighter with some extra parts if want to. I will probably goto a dura ace 7800 crank soon, and I plan to goto Mavic Ksyrium wheels, but not for a year or so. I love this bike, and it can hold it's own in any scenario. Bike is definitely better than the rider!!

i only bought the bike this week and today was my first ride on it. all i can say is ""wow."" prior to deciding to buy the madone i read reviews on this site, and others, to help me make my decision. anyway, back to my first ride today. the acceleration on this bike is unbelievable (i have spent the last year riding a dawes giro 400, which is a road bike, and not a race bike). the handling of the madone is very stable, and the buzzkill inserts really do absorb road vibration. more than i would have imagined. this bike is more aimed at serious road racers, but i feel that if anyone wants a really lightweight road bike should really consider this bike. i did, and have already fallen in lve with it. i have yet to climb any serious hills on this machine, but i am looking forward to that. i will post another review in a couple of months to give a more objective description (although, i think that it is unlikely to change).

What a climb! 10 miles of 9 & 10% grade. The bike was fantastic. I need to work on my hills. Down the backside was the first time I hit 40mph. No shudder or vibration and cornered great. I'm not sure I would have made it on my aluminum 2100. The styling and Ultegra components are amazing.

Strength:
Light, fast, ultegra, team colors look amazing


Weakness:
rough shift under stress with 3 cog system, got it fixed though


Just upgraded to this beast of a cycle a couple of days ago. I was shopping for a trek 5000 since i was looking to make the leap from alumuminum to carbon. Went to the trek store saw the madone was marked down from $3299 to $1999!! It was only 300 bucks more than the 5000 so i figured why not get a great bike instead of a good bike. Bike fits me perfectly and rides very smooth. The bike is light but stiff and climbs like a champion.

walked in the bike shop to buy lube and spent 2500 bucks!! the bike was calling me. oh and it was marked down. great ride, fits me perfictuly, and is 10 times more comfortable than the litespeed hyperion i was riding. the seat sucked and was replaced imediatdly with the sella i scavenged from the litespeed before i sold it. Conti,s are going on it tomarrow because i happen to have a set of grand prix 4000s in the garage and the bontragers dont give me alot of confidence like conti,s have for about 16 years. overall i get excited just thinking about going for a ride on this bike and that will magnify as soon as i put some mavic sl,s on it.

Strength:
Excellent handlingExcellent climbingExcellent road feelExcellent vibration dampeningMinimizes rider fatigue on 4+ hour tripsGreat performance from Bontrager partsVery lightUltegra parts package performs flawlesslyGood bang for buck


Weakness:
Bontrager tires both tore within 500 milesI hate Trek's paint jobsMost riders will probably jump to the 5.9 because Dura Ace is shiny


I used to race and demand a pretty high level of performance from bikes. I weighed between this setup and a Pegoretti Love 3 (its a hand made Italian frame) and ended up giving the nod to the Trek primarily because of the significant price savings. This machine is everything a weekend warrior could ever want in a bike. I would wager to say that 99.9% of riders, in a blind, stripped down bike, would never be able to tell the difference between Ultegra and Dura Ace these days and I certainly think that this bike is a great place to draw the line on bang for the buck. It is extremely fast, cranks up beautifully, dampens road vibrations, eliminates rider fatigue, and still delivers killer performance in average riding. Would I take it straight to the front of the pack in a Cat 2 race? Probably not, that's what the 5.9 is for (although I wouldn't feel ashamed to have this in a Cat 5 setup). Would I encourage every day riders who don't need Dura Ace to feel better about themselves to buy this bike? Absolutely. The Bontrager parts deliver excellent performance and I have had zero problems with this bike in the few thousand miles I've put on it so far. The bike climbs so well that, quite honestly, you are better off clocking more hours on the rig than you are getting the triple. I have climbed nasty hills with no fuel left in my tank and still been astounded at how eager this bike is to shoot up everything. If you want a bike that rides like a racer but don't actually play with the pack, this is a great place to look.

Strength:
The Trek Madone 5.2 is super light, approximately 18 pounds with options. Looks great and I get excited every time I want to ride. So far I have only put 500 miles on it but many more to come. Handles quick and positive. I see other complaints on the saddle but I like mine very much.


Weakness:
I have had 2 flats in 500 miles with out any apparent reason or tire damage. I hope replaceing the thin inner tubes will stop the flats. Bike is set up with a triple sprocket and shifting has been a problem. It does not like to downshift under power. Dealer has tried once to correct it but without success. I assume since I have not seen other complaints that it can be taken care of. I wish the bike was not so stiff. At 30MPH descent I hit a washboard section of road that blew my hands off of the bars. Very scary for a moment.


Purchased bike as a pre-retirement present to myself. I have joined local club and hope to spent lots of time in the saddle in the years ahead. This is my first road bike after riding several years on a ""High End"" Hybrid. I wanted a bike to be faster, lighter and capable of longer distances than my current ride.

Strength:
stiff, fast and light for a the price: 18.5 lbs (57cm) a thing of beauty.


Weakness:
saddle, brake pads and tires and the motor is way out of tune.


Well here it goes.2007 Lemond - TourmaletAfter testing a 2006 Tourmalet at another lbs. I decided to get it from my local shop.... well lo and behold when i had all the money 1.5 weeks later.. they informed me that I could no longer by an 06' so the guy informed me that he could obtain the 07 in 4 days.... well he gave me a great price and the bike was ordered. a brand spanking new 57 cm. 2007 Lemond- Tourmalet...that thing is beautiful. Full on Metallic Red and Pearl White. it looks like an Italian sports car in the bright texas sun.... Mario Andretti woul be envious.well enough of the glam. the bike sports a almost full 105 groupo. I say almost cuz the brake calipers are Cane creek. the rest is bonti'. yup saddle bars, stem, seatpost and fork.well the bike is quick and stiff. like a crit bike. but yet extremely comfortable.it handles very quick. it seems to want to dive into every corner. on desents it only wants to go faster. I dont dare push it going down this twisty hill the bontrager tires are nothing more than rim protecters (cant wait till i get some conti's on). the wheels are not too bad. a little on the heavy side for a road set. but other wise built very well.600 miles of southwest roads and still true. the geometry on the frame was made for climbing... slack seat angle lets you push a gear lower than usual. and the bottom bracket is super stiff and just wants to take off when you sprint... almost minimal fram flex ( this cat weighs 220.lbs.) so im not one of these 135 lb. mountain goats. over all I have been very impressed with the ride and handling characteristics of this bike. The only thing i would change is the saddle. break pads and tires of course... other than that the bike is perfect...

Strength:
Light, responsive, wonderful climber


Weakness:
Price? Not really. Let’s be honest, I didn’t have to get a Madone, I chose to get a Madone and isometimes you have to pay to play.


Bike is actually a 2006.  Summary:I have waited to review the Madone until I had around a thousand miles on it. I wanted to be sure the first impressions I had were true. And they were. This thing rocks. . Before I bought my Madone I was told that it is the best all-around bike and I believe it . The Madone is incredibly stiff and climbs like a mountain goat. It is so responsive to every rider input and quite honestly, it should be, it was engineered for Lance! Although some have complained about the saddle on the 5.2, I don’t think it is all that bad. It may not look like much, but it seems pretty comfortable to me, and I have taken it on several 5 hour training rides as well as the 130 mile Cool Breeze Century in Ventura,CA. I love to climb and the Madone keeps begging for more.

Ultegra hardware, super light, fairly stiff, loves to climb, likes to go fast even more. All carbon! Although other reviews knock the saddle, I really like it and find it very comfy.


Weakness:
Price, you can feel the road bumps more than an aluminum frame.


Actually, I bought the 2006 5.2 and it is exactly what I was looking for. It begs to go fast. It is quick and responsive. It is light enough to fly up climbs and has a triple to help scream down the other side. It is very agile as well. I've added about 2 mph to my average and want to just keep riding after the club ride is over. If your thinking about one, just take it for a test ride and you will be sold!

Egronomically sound. Fast. Beautiful to look at (I have a Project One) and efficient at putting power to the road.


Weakness:
Stock saddle belongs on a department store bike! Tires could be have better flat resistance. Paint could have a tougher clearcoat finish.


I have purused the other reviews of this bike and I agree that it is a stellar performer for the money. It is resonably light, fast on the flats, responsive without being twitchy, comfortable, but still stiff enough to put your power to the road. I came from an aluminum race bike to this and it is much easier on the upper body to ride (neck & shoulders). The carbon doesn't have a dead feel either - the bike exudes a spirited personality. She likes to go fast! This is my Ferrari...simply a joy to send time on!

Scott, your pedal(s) probably isn't torque'ed and greased adequately. ""Tight"" isn't adequate. It's a fairly common issue with the newer Shimano cranks. The carbon frame amplifies the sound and feel.

I purchase a 5.2 Madone Trek bike last year June 2005. After riding this bike for 40 to 50 miles I developed a noise in the bike I returned the bike to Trek and they said they could not find this noise. I have taken this bike to several bike shops they all say they can not hear this noise. I ride with a lot of different people they all say this is the noise bike they have ever heard, to a point they all say they will never buy a trek bike. The noise sounds like the small crank gear is rubbing the noise does not happen on the large gear.The bike has a great ride but if your are critical to a noisy bike do not buy a Trek 5.2 Madone.

So my Madone is acually a '06. This bike is amazing! No matter how fast you are going on it, it wants to go faster. It's a weird feeling, and sucks if you want to slow down. Bike is very manuverable, and very, very light. It rides so much nicer than my older 5200 did. The carbon soaks up bumps like no other. The bike responds great to just one pedal stroke. Buy this bike! You won't be dissapointed.

2006 Madone 5.2 in fabulous dark carbon tone-- some of the carbond weave texture pokes through the paint purposely and it looks great. My first road bike since middle school paper route (regular mountain biker lately), but after about 500 miles I have to say I love it. Glad I spend the extra over the 5200 or even something less. Just when you think you are out of gas, you stand up on it and the bike responds to your first crank. Having a great bike helps encourage me to get on it every day. Having ridden no other road bikes, I can't compare it to much, but I can't imagine it getting much better for the money. I bought this one to train and ride in centuries and the RAIN ride in Indiana (160 miles) and as a newbie I have found this bike comfortable and fast.

I have the 2006 Discovery Team blue model. This bike has it all...stiffness, comfort and power to boot. When you drop the hammer it responds instantly. Stiffer than my 2004 5200 but more comfortable. A tremendous value. I am very happy that I upgraded.

standard Bontrager race-light wheels.


This review is for the 2006 model Madone 5.2 (color carbon pearl)with Ultegra 3x10. I've changed the saddle (an ""ugly"" bontrager race light lux) for an San Marco era, it looks better on the bike, and I'm used to it. I also bought another set of wheels Easton Orion 2 (michelin pro2 race tyres), they are lighter and stiffer. I'm glad that I bought this bike, the OCLV carbon has prove itself over the years, and the bike rides good. Very responsive, but never too nervous. I'm a big guy, but I rely completely on it in a descent with higher speed. It's very well balanced between competative riding and comfort on longer trips.

Strength:
Very comfortable frame wigh good stiffness and shock absorbtion. The 10 speed Ultegra works very well and I really like the comfort and shape of the new Ultegra shifters. The bike is a little lighter than my 2002 Trek 5200 and feels slightly stiffer and little more responsive. But it is just as comfortable after 50 miles or so.

Weakness:
None yet. I'll keep you posted.


This is for 2006 Trek Madone 5.5 CD 62 cmProject One. This is same frame as used on the Trek 5.2 Madone, except for the Dura Ace components.This is a sweet ride. The Project One paint makes it unique. After having ridden a Specialized Allez Elite for 5-years this was a major upgrade for me. I had carpal tunnel surgery on both hands and a left ulnar nerve transpostion. I read some of the reviews on carbon frames and felt this might provide some relief. The Carbon frame does abosorb most of the road vibrations and haven't caused me any problems on my last ride of 62-miles. At 230 lbs I haven't had too much noticeable flex. The wheels have needed to be checked and spokes tightend afte 200 miles. The compact drive has responed better than expected. Having used a Triple Crank for the last 5-years, the Compact Drive and the bicycles weight has made it easier to climb hills.I'll post more after I've logged a few hundred more miles.

Weakness:
Stock Bontrager Race lite Lux saddle. Too soft! Stock bontrager tires are fast, but puncture prone.


I went looking for a new road bike to compliment my mountain biking. I stopped atthe best little bike shop in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, THE SPORTS RACK, LTD., of Marquette, Mi. They let be try a 2005 TREK 5000 which I liked, but wanted a little more. I was shown the Madone 5.2 and they told me take it home for the weekend. I did, took one ride and I was hooked! This bike climbs great, is fast on the flats and handles like a slot car. I bought it on the spot. I swapped out a few parts to more of my liking(saddle, stem and bars) and I have one killer bike! TREK outperforms all others when it comes to carbon fiber road bikes hands down!

Strength:
Frame is A+++. Perfect combination of stiffness and shock absorbing. Great price. You would be hard pressed to find a better bike in this price range!


Weakness:
Stock Wheels are awful... I am a light 150 pound guy at 6'0 and noticed the flex in the wheels.


Just picked up a 2006 5.2 Madone Team Colors. Upgraded it to full Dura Ace and Mavic Kysirums SL for $2900. I purchased this bike due to a SLAP and Posterior Labral tear in my shoulder that will keep me out of triathlon for this year. I needed a new road bike that would absorb most road shock but be stiff enough to still put in some serious workouts. That being said before I had surgery in late January I took a trip out to Austin to get one last bit of ridding in. I rentedand tested 4 different bikes from Bicycle Sport Shop in Austin TX !!GREAT SHOP!! (Madone 5.2,Madone 5.2SL Tarmac pro, cannondale6-13) and gave them each a day of 50+ miles to really get a feel for each bike. The Tarmac and Cannondale were both very stiff and agressive but seemed to chatter a bit on the road. The Madone 5.2 SL climbed well but felt a little sluggish on the flats. Which brought me to the 5.2. It handled so well. An OK climb but great on the downhill and fast on the flats. It is an all around amazing ride. To all possible buyers save the money from the 5.9 and go with the 5.2. Upgrade the componets and the wheels to Kysirums Sl. They are a MUST HAVE!!!

Weakness:
None.


This is a 2006 Madone 5.2, size 60 Discovery, 120 carbon. I picked it up on Dec. 21. I have been riding my '02 aluminum Cervelo P2K for the past four years. First time on carbon and I am blown away by the difference. My next tri bike will be carbon for sure. I waited 3 1/2 months but it was worth it. According to the shop Trek didn't have a 60 in stock so the wait is caused by the schedule in producing size runs. I know someone who just bought a 5.9 and is getting it in a week, they had his size in stock. I guess you can't rush quality. The more I ride it the more I love it. The carbon rides stiff but supple. I think this bike is for anyone who is looking for performance.

This is a 2006. I bought the bike 2 days before Christmas and promptly got the flu. The first ride, however, made me a believer in the grace and quality of these bikes....

Actually it is a 2006 model. The bike handles wonderfully. The power transfer is immediate. The frame soaks up road imperfections, yet delivers performance feedback. I cannot say enough good things about this machine. I wanted a bike that I can ride a century on one weekend and compete in a Cat 5 the next. This is THE machine to meet all of your cycling needs without breaking the bank.

Strength:

Weakness:
For a bike of this price, could probably have used lighter and faster wheels. Bontrager X Lite do the job correctly, but for the price of the bike, I would have liked better quality wheels (but yes, they do look good).


Carbon frame! What a delightful change from the good old Cr-Mo. The Madone 5.2 is an incredible bike. The lightness and stiffness of the frame combined with the Ultegra grouppo make this bike an incredible climber. There is absolutely no loss of energy in this bike. Also, the bike seems to absorb vibrations from the road a lot better than other bikes I've tried. I bought this bike at the end of the season, so I have not put to many km yet onto it (<500km), but I am amazed how well it responds and accelerates. The bike has the double crankset. Of course, no problem have yet occured with derailleurs or brakes. This is by far the best road bike I have ever ridden. I just can't stop thinking about my next ride.

I love this bike! I started the ordering process 11/04--good thing! The store had to order one in in my size (60cm). I had the option of waiting for a nude/grey bike with a double up front or having the Trek rep ship a tripple in Postal Livery from another local dealer. I opted for the latter, put it on lay-away until I had it paid off in 2/05.

The bike is great - light, stiff, comfortable to ride, accelorates like a rocket, agile but not squirly, soaks up road buzz. I have not noticed the ""dead wood"" feel some other riders report about carbon frames. I have 2000 miles on it already and every time I look at it I want to ride it.

Strength:
Climbing.(!!!) Also, the flexibility of selecting exactly the components I wanted via Trek's Project One program. Finally, the sheer value for the money spent.


Weakness:
Delivery time (I waited approx 4 weeks but it was WELL WORTH the wait). I can't find any other weakness yet...


My Trek Madone 5.2 is SO fast, it climbs hills amazingly well & it corners like a speed demon. This bike is light, fast & it meets every expectation I had in terms of performance.

In terms of components, I selected Campagnolo Chorus for my bike & the end result is not only beautiful but it performs flawlessly.

Performance aside, I LOVE the look of this bike--the aero design screams 'speed' & the Pearl Grey Carbon paint looks very classy. I elected not to do a custom paint job (although this was an option for an additional cost).

There is a WSD specific version of the Trek Madone--while I am female, I did not go with the WSD model since the standard Trek Madone 5.2 was a better fit (pun intended) for my needs.

I highly recommend the Trek Madone 5.2. I had a wonderful ordering experience with Trek's Project One program & my Trek dealer (The Spin Cycle) was an absolute class act.

I new that this could be the bike I would love. After having a shoulder operation I was very uncomfortable on my steel steed my shoulder was killing me. I have about 80 miles on my Madone and it so far has hardly bothered my shoulder which leads me to believe that the dampening quality is excellent. The bike climbs and sprints like a dream. I would be hard pressed to ride a different bike. I used to have the 5200 which I enjoyed. It may be my imagination but this bike is so sweet and smooth you do not have tired body parts from road vibration.This bike is worth the money!

I bought this bike on sale and have been completly satisfied with the purchase. I researched a lot of bikes and nearly bought a Felt F75 which almost identical to the 2100. I also looked a specialized Allez, but I think you get a little more with Trek, ultegra(rear), Cane creek brakes and low count spoke wheels. The ride is exceptionally smooth, I can ride all day with little or no soreness. the 105's function as they should and the rear ultegra derailuer is as smooth as the rest of the bike. I plan on riding this bike for a long time and have installed aero bars for the triathlons I do. I also want to thank all the people who have posted here, I used this site a lot when i was shopping and found the reviews a great help... THANKS!!

Strength:
good entry level bike, though you can get a lot more for the money if you are willing to buy used (very risky though)


Weakness:
The wheels it comes with take some TLC, I've ruined two rears and one front wheel from usage(also the 5 or so wrecks I've had probably didn't help)


I bought this bike two years ago with an unclear idea of what I wanted to do with cycling. The price point appealed to me, as I had no other knowledge of bicycles.   I road the bike into the ground for several months. Never changed a tire or tube, no chain lubing, no real maintenance at all. Shortly there after I decided to actually join a cycling team, since that time I've become a bicycle mechanic, so it does tend to get taken care of now.   Long story short, the bike does everything it should, I'm a big guy, over 190 and it has been solid for me. Though the components aren't the best they do work well for a fairly long time. I've been riding over 10k miles a year and have gotten fairly lucky I guess.   Two of my very close friends also bought this bike after seeing the increase in fitness I had as well as the enjoyment to be had on a bike.   So I would recommended this bike to a friend who was interested in getting into cycling. I would get another one myself as my current bike is no longer safely ridable after my latest wreck, but I think I'll probably upgrade a bit instead.

I bought this bike to start riding bikes and get fit again. Once I started to Scycle I loved it. This was a great bike to buy because the Fram is pretty good and the bike has enough features that you don't grow out of it fast. This was a great first bike to have. I have ranked this bike a 4, beacuse It's not the top end bike, buy it is a nice bike.

Strength:
105 is super solid and besides for the seat and pedals the bike is really well specd' for the price.


Weakness:
The seat is crappy, but to be honest I switched it out when I bought the bike. The bottom bracket is begining to creek.. The cane creek brakes need to be pushed square from time to time but I think most road brakes are that way.


This bike is great. I have had it about 8 months, but I waited to have a full season to give it a honest review. I probably have about a 1000+ miles on it and I have done one dualatlon and two tri's with it. I have a 63cm and I am 6' 5"" and it fits me well. I highly recommend the bike rack. Hal, (one of the owners) spent an hour with me fitting the bike and did not charge me an extra cent. I have put some decent miles on it and it still has not been back for a tune up! I could not affoard a full carbon bike, so i appriciate the carbon stays. I guess I really do not know any better becasue I came riding a mt. bike.

Strength:
- Very responsive- Good components for the price - Comfortable and smooth


Weakness:
- Seat- Brakes could be better- A few ""creaking"" noises when climbing uphill


I'd been riding a Trek 7200 hybrid for about two or three years and have wanted to upgrade to a road bike for some time. After a little research, I decided the 2100 had most of things I wanted (Plus, AMX had it in their membership rewards program!) Now that I've had the bike for about three months I wonder why I didn't upgrade sooner. It's been exactly what I was hoping for in an entry level machine. It's light, responsive, fast, and maybe most important reliable. (since I'm not the best mechanic) The bike came with mostly 105 componentry and Ultegra for the rear deraileur. Generally, I'm impressed with how smooth each shift is. However, at times I do have trouble going from the small chain ring to the big chain ring in the front. I may have my local shop take look to see if it needs adjusting. I did upgrade the pedals to 105's, and will probably get a new seat soon. The one it came with just doesn't cut it. Since I'm new to the sport, I can't decide if brakes on a road bike just don't work as well as on other bikes, or if the Cane Creek brakes need to be upgraded.

This is the second year I have had this bike . It is a good commuter/recreational bike. I bought the bike to train for mountain bike racing and start to get into road racing. It is not a race bike unless you have no power.  I rip the chain off the big ring all the time, do to frame flex. I first lost the chain sprinting. The club I race with told me to try lossening me grip on the bar, that helped but it is not confidence inspiring to sprint without closing your hands on the bar. I have also lost the chain setted powering up climbs. So let me be clear this bike is not bad but may not be the best for a powerfull guy getting into racing

Strength:
Very stiff, pretty light, nice and fast.


Weakness:
Cane Creek brakes come out of alignment every once in a while.


I bought this bike in September last year, and have ridden it around 1400 miles since. It's a really nice bike. I've taken it on a one-night cycle-camping trip with a 13 pound load, and it held a line really well.  The only thing I can find to complain about is that the Cane Creek 3 brakes are always coming out of alignment. It's easy enough to fix, just a few turns of a screw, but it can be annoying on longer rides.  The stock saddle is also a bit hard, but it's not too bad. (I've ridden on it 1400 miles and I'm not dead yet, though I am planning to get another one.) It is a good bike, though. Great for a beginner wanting a good bike that won't need upgrading unless you want to become a racer, and even then it could suffice.

Weakness:
TCT carbon sucks compared to OCLV carbon. See summary above.


I really bought the bike at $1499.99 + tax but I upgraded the 105 to an Ultegra, the Bontrager Select stem to an Easton EA70, the Bontrager Race Lite to a Shimano WH-R550, the tires from Bontrager to Kenda Kaliente.Anyway the bike has been great. Fast acceleration, very light because of Trek's exclusive ZR9000 alloy, an is relatively cheap for its type, especially when I bought it during the Trek discount says. There is just one problem I got with the bike. The carbon seatstays are not as good as the OCLV carbon, because just after using the bike for about 300 kilometers without crashes, I found a void with a small 4mm crack just behind the brake caliper. It's minor but it's still a visible air pocket.

Weakness:

My 2100 is worth $2000 because I upgraded it with a full Ultegra 10-speed groupset. The bike works nicely. It accelerates fast and it's lighter than many bikes of its category because of its ZR9000. The Bontrager Bzzzkills and carbon fiber seat stays make the ride very smooth. Although the carbon fiber is nothing too special. It is only TCT and with only about 300 kilometers on it without scratches, I have already discovered a void just behind the rear brake caliper. There is a small crack about 4mm in length which may have caused the air pocket.

Weakness:
The seat is uncomfortable and a little wide for my liking, it will be going soon. The Bontrager tires take a little getting used to and they track funny at anything over 35mph, when new, they need time to break in a little, although they are very tough, no punctures yet!


Well this is my first road bike, and it has been a blast. I read a lot of reviews about various products on this site, and I demo'd a few before I stuck with the 2100. I originally planned on going cheap with my entry level purchase, but I ended up with a little extra so I went for the 2100. This is a great entry level bike for somebody considering getting into road. The bike handles well, eats up most bumps well and has been nearly trouble free. I'm nearing 500mi. and I have yet to have any major breakdown of the stock components. The front derailer could use a little adjustment, but other then that the bike is very solid. If you're debating a road bike purchase, give this one a try at least, you might be suprised.

Rides so much better than my Trek 1200. I've rode this bike 4000 miles, and I have yet to have a single problem. I've climbed mountains, rode centuries, raced collegiately, and this bike has performed flawlessly. Furthermore, it soaks up the road vibrations extremely well for an aluminum frame. I attribute this to the carbon seat stays. I would recommend the 2100 to the cyclist who doesn't want to spend a pirates treasure on a bike, yet desires performance.

Saddle really sucks. If that's all I have to complain about, it's a pretty sweet bike.


Broke the frame on my faithful '87 TREK 1500  and got an outstanding warranty credit from Trek which I spent on a 2006 2100. Test rode several Trek bikes but really liked the responsiveness of this aluminum/carbon mix frame. The power goes straight to the wheel, the shifting is effortless and I go 2mph faster over the same course. Surprised that the stock wheels could handle my hefty 225# weight but they're still true after 350 miles. Saddle is awful so I replaced that immediately. Triple crank gives you confidence that you can't find a hill you can't climb. I've never used the granny yet as the bike climbs effortlessly (though the engine huffs and puffs a bit.) All told, an outstanding bike for the price. If you're in the market, test ride it.

Strength:
Power transfer is unreal.


Weakness:
The Cane Creek Brakes are less than impressive. The brake pads and calipers can use an upgrade to 105?


This is for the 2006 model.  I was looking at the $1000 price range which included an OCR-1, Felt F80, and a leftover Bianchi Giro.  But I stumbled upon this '06 model for $1099, and for the components compared to the three bikes above, this was the deal of the century.  I'm sure at $1499, there would be more brands to look at comparatively, but it was a no brainer at $1099. None of the bikes above had all 3: the carbon fork, carbon rear stay, carbon seat post.  Add on that the 105 components with Ultegra RD, then it had me sold. The ride: After riding the Giant, and Bianchi, the comparison for me was like night and day.  Every stroke is transferred to power with the 2100. What a difference all the carbon makes!  It's the ZZR frame with lifetime warranty so this frame will be with me for quite some time.  Have done 300 miles thusfar and the wheels are still in tru.No problems with the shifting after the break-in and minor adjustments.  Seat has been good to me upto 75 miles, but it will prob be the first I thing I replace.  The bontrager components are known more for their sturdiness than lightness. The bike weighs in for me at 20 lbs.

I had to replace triathlon bike but decided to go with a bike that could do lots of styles of riding. I put 190 miles in the first week. Usually problems appear fast, but it has been perfect. Only 2 cogs on front. I can't comprehend ever needing a third cog on front. 10 gears on back, two on front are plenty for just about any hill.

For a company like Trek with such a nice frame you'd think they would do better with the seat and drive train. If you can afford it go for all Ultegra or better components minimum.


The Trek 2100 is a great frame. The seat is a throw away. Swapped the pedels out for a set of Look PP396. Replaced the Bontrager front crank within a week for a Shimano Ultegra front crank. The Bontrager Race Lite wheels are ok but not great. Should have bought the Trek 2200 or better, but for the money it's hard to beat.

Weakness:
Seat needs replacing.


I have owned my 2100 for 8 months. This is my first road bike and during this time I have been getting the serious education on the do's and do nots when it comes to road bicyling. During my travels I have encountered some unbelievable cyclist. Since I average about 120 miles a week this road bike was an excellent choice. I was not as lucky as some of you who purchased your bike with some upgrages. My bike is Shimano 105 all over. After the first 2 weeks the front derailer needed some adjustments. There is still some unwanted noise and delay when shifting to the front big ring. After that its smooth sailing.

I have a triple ring and now I don't ever use the granny case ever. Even on the steepest hill I can still climb in the second ring. I won't switch to a double because it's not necessary. The only negative I have is that you may have to change the seat. The tires that comes with the bike are the Bontrager X Lite. It is a good tire for commuting purposes. If you want to go faster than I recommend a much lighter tire. My front tire has lasted over 5000 miles. I have gone through 2 back tires and now both tires need replacing. I recommend the Vred Fortezzi (Cheap and a decent commuter with speed). 

Overall I would rate this bike excellent for a newbie that intends to get serious. This bike will suit all your needs and more. I am now at a point in my training that I can outride the average riders and give the excellent riders a run for their money. As for the pros.... they let me know where I stand within the first half mile before I crack. I still need the work.

I have no real complaints about this bike, this being my first road bike. The pedals leave something to be desired, but they are livable until you can get a better upgrade.


This being my first road bike, I turned here to these reviews for comparison shopping before I bought. With less than a month and about 300+ miles so far, I am absolutely impressed.

Strength:

carbon fork and carbon seat stays


Weakness:
stock shimano pedals are junk,mine blew apart after 5 miles. I would recommend upgrading them before you leave the bikeshop.


I had been shopping for a bike in the 1000-1500 dollar price category that would perform well enough for the recreational racer,but comfortable enough for everyday riding.

 My previous bike was a 2001 cannondale R400 with shimano sora groupo. I purchased that bike new as an entry level racer and started riding and it got me buy for a few years,I logged roughly 2,000 miles on the old caad 3 and was looking to upgrade. I looked at the cost to upgrade the old bike and it just was not cost effective.

 After looking at all the different brands in my price range I had narrowed it down to the cannondale r1000,giant tcr alloy,and the trek 2100/2300.

 I wanted a bike with at least shimano 105 and ultimately decided on the 05 trek 2100. I don't know why but my trek 2100 came with ultegra shifters,ultegra rear derailier,105 front and 105 brakes/105 cranks. I am guessing that it was a late in the year upgrade,because the equipment is more comparable to that found on the 06 trek 2200.

 After riding the Trek 2100 I was overwhelmed at how smooth it rode,how fast it picked up speed,and how buttery smooth the shifting was,basically it made my old cannondale feel like a brick. what a difference the carbon fork and seat stays make in the ride. 

 Overall I really can't complain about anything, it really gives you a taste for what the really high end bikes feel like without breaking the bank. It is race worthy,comfortable,and an absolute bargain. 

 As stated previously my bike came with some significant upgrades compared to earlier released 2100's, so if you are fortunate enough to find one with the ultegra flight deck ,then look no further,if not start shopping for the 06 trek 2200.

Handling and smooth as silk ride


Weakness:
Weight
MSRP pricing


After a few months of seacrhing I finally ran into this bike at my LBS while getting a wheel trued. I was lucky enough to pick it up 500 off msrp as it had already been raced twice. Overall this bike is amazing. The carbon fork and seatstays eat up the road and give the bike an unbelievable amount of handling. I have fallen in love with the ride which is smoother and faster than anything else I've ever been on. I am not sure however if this bike would have stayed competitive in its original price range, but if you are able to get it at a markdown you'll have trouble beating the component and frame quality. I was also a little iffy on the bontrager components at first having never really delt with them, but after riding them would put rate them exactly the same if not better than other brands. Especially the external BB Race Lite cranks which feel stiffer even then FSA Gossamers. The bike is a little heavier than some models at around 20 lbs. for a 58cm, but you would never know the difference while riding because of the quality of the frame. I srtongly recommend this bike especially to beginners looking to take their next step up.

I wanted a bike with a good frame that was upgradeable and this is it. The bike is light for its price and climbs well. I've had no problems with the crank or the front derailer. It does creak when climbing out of the saddle. Brake pads should definitely be switched out. I've hit 45 mph downhill and the bike handled well. The bike is easily upgradeable.

Strength:
Geometry, Carbon Fiber, Ultrega RD, 105 elsewhere,


Weakness:
Maybe brakes


I recently moved from the Washington DC area to San Jose CA, and I had to find a new spoort since there isn't much local white water kayaking. I saw that there were lots of road bikers and lots of bike lanes so I dusted off my old MTB and started biking. 500mi later I decided that it was time to start looking for my first road bike. 

I'm 5'10"", 170lbs, I wanted to spend about $1500 and would love to have carbon fiber, I usually shoot for about 100mi a week, and might like to try a triathlon. I tried Giant OCR Composite 3, too small felt like I was riding a clown bike, asked the bike shop if I could try a longer stem....they said they didn't have any (that shop was out). Next was Sepcialized, didn't really like the way they felt. Tried a couple of LeMonds, better but still too small, Klein Reve w/ SPA, nice but not quite right, then the Trek 5000, the geomerty was right and the Carbon was a dream, but the price was a nightmere. So I settled on the 2100 w/ Ultrega RD and am very happy. So far after about 200mi I have no complaints. It is so fast, and light, compared to MTB w/ slicks, and stable at speeds. 

The Carbon fork does a good job at filtering road hum,and the rear Carbon seat stay is nice too. The 105 drive train was the level that I wanted, the Ultegra RD was a nice suprise. The brakes could be better, I think that I might swich out brake pads in a bit, also the seat seems a bit soft. The LBS couldn't have been more helpful, I tried a lot of bikes. I even had my wife get a bike from them (Trek 7500 FX Disk).

Strength:
Stiff, solid, nice feel, relativly good components for the price.


Weakness:
Flexy in larger size, alittle heavy for the price.


I have had the oportunity to ride and race an 05 Trek 2100 for over 6 months now. I was orginally looking for a durable bike with carbon stays that was relativly lite. Most importantly I wanted to the biek to survive a crash at 30 MPH (say criterium). I was a little afraid of a full carbon frame for this application so the 2100 fit the bill. 

The bike originally came equiped with ultegra 105 drivetrain with a ISIS race lite triple crankset. The bike is a 63 cm model with a race 130 mm stem and 175 mm cranks. I had no interntions of keeping the bike stock. In stock form the bike is very responsive and reasonably lite for its size. It is quite regid (read my notes on racing) but a little flexy at rediciously high speeds. The drivetrain worked well for a triple but was a little rough at times. 

About 2 months into having the bike I was hit by a car while on a training ride. The bike and myself went down hard. I was hurt rather badly but the bike did not revieve any significant damage. Upon tear down we found the frame untouched but the shifters and crankset were distroyed. The wheelset (which was race x lite areo from new) was un touched. We did find a defect in the original crankset (the carnk arm was laterially twisted) and bontrager replaced the entire crankset. 

After the crash the bike was built with the same race lite crankset with a 53-39-30 triple which performed well. We had to go to a dura ace triple front deraileur to make it work. I can say it was an increadle ratio in a triple. 

After my first criterium of the season we swaped out the entire drive train for dura ace 10 double with 180 mm crankarms. With a new saddle and seatpost the bike weighted in at 19.5 pounds (that is 3 pounds less than stock). 

During racing the bike is increadably stiff. My major issue is the flex in the carbon stays are very high speed out of the saddle. While it is notible it does not make a huge difference in power. It is kind off annoying at high speeds though. Of course the flexing occurs at over 28 MPH which sprinting out of the saddle in high (53-13 and 53-12) gearing.

Strength:
Light, great climbing frame. The carbon stays are not a gimmick. Very smooth riding bike.


Weakness:
The carbon fork is a bit flexy. The brakes (no name) have awful pads in them. The Bontrager Select wheelset/tire combo has been very durable, but not very light.


Bought the bike in August, loved it from the word go. The frameset is smooth and comfortable, but still reasonably stiff. Shifting on the factory setup was reasonably crisp. The brakes worked pretty well, but a pad upgrade is planned when the stockers are done. Wheels and tires are great, but not light. The Bonty select series has been durable and fun to ride.

This review is for the 2005 model. I got a killer deal thru a club sponsor, and you should not expect such a good price this early. Trek upgraded some components this year, and you now get lots of Ultegra goodies and some 105 stuff that makes this bike an excellent value. One upgrade is the Bontrager crankset, which Trek cannot currently supply all their bikes with. Mine had a 105 triple which I upgraded to an Ultegra double. Overall, lots of bike for the $, and with this year's upgrades no reason to spend more. Very smooth, tight ride, nice turning radius in my 56cm size. Carbon stuff (seat stays, seatpost, fork) make ride smooth.

Strength:
Carbon seat stays, Bontrager components, Ultegra rear. Quality pedals included, while other manufacturers do not include pedals. Triple crank


Weakness:
The biggest weakness in my opinion is the decals. They easily rub and look bad after transporting with a Thule Expressway rack. But it says a lot for this bike when the biggest complaint is the decals. Trek could also add a wider selection of color schemes to choose from.


I love this bike. When I began shopping for a new road bike, I had my mind set on a Cannondale R700. Through ""coaxing"" from my wife, I decided to compare all brands in a similar price range before shoveling out hard earned money. It was then that I found the Trek 2100. In my opinion the Trek was easily the best bike for the money. I have owned this bike for 3 months now and used it to race in a Triathlon and Bogus Basin Hill climb. Performance was top notch during both of these very different events. The bike is fast and responsive. The carbon seat stays and forks truely absorb vibration and shock which makes a comfortable ride. I've hit some nasty bumps during periods of unattentive riding and the Bontrager wheels have remained true under my 200lb frame. For an extra $35 dollars I had my bike shop ugrade the front derailleur to Ultegra, so I can't comment on the Tiagra front derailleur performance. 105 shifters have performed trouble free. I've used Ultegra shifters in the past and the only difference I've noticed with the 105's is quality of material. That could possibly mean an upgrade in the future, but for now I have no plans to upgrade. I've read a few complaints about the pedals. Although I did replace the pedals with Shimano Ultegras, (just a personal preference) I mounted the stock Shimano 520's on my mountain bike and they work great. Very easy to clip in and out, no knee pain from amount of float. The stock saddle will get you by for a while, but plan to upgrade. The low end brakes have performed trouble free, especially during downhill from rides to the local ski lodge. Overall, Im a casual racer who rides roughly 120 miles per week. I wouldn't benefit from purchasing a 2-5 thousand dollar full carbon bike, but the 2100 gives me a taste of high end performance at a moderate price. Compare everything in your price range and I'm confident you will choose the Trek.

Like most everyone else I looked at the 1500 and for $300 more chose the 2100.

I'm not sure how it happened but mine came with Ultegra shifters instead of the 105's. Could be a mistake or late in the model year but I'm glad it happened.

I've been wanted to buy a road bike for some time now as I've been using my mtn bike for mostly road.

The difference in components is nominal but ride is where its at. The 2100 with the carbon seat post and rear stays make a world of difference. Granted I only paid $482 out the door because of the Trek coupon but if you can swing the difference between the 2 bike go for the 2100.

I am new to road biking. Shopped around for different Brands - Specialized/ Cannondale/Fuji/Trek and then decided on either Trek 2300 or 2100. 5200 is way too much for a newbie. Test rode 2300, but decided not to pay that much for just the components, so settled for the most economic 2100. 2100 during the testride itself was great and is still great. Climbs well ! Had initial trouble with the Front derailleur - but gotten used to it. I guess it is very light (approx 20lbs) for my 63cm bike. Carbon fork, seat post helps when the road is rough. Upon LBS recommendation, went for Race X Lite Tires - needed 120psi. Triple chainring is very useful as i am a poor climber.

Strength:
This blend of carbon and aluminum makes for a workhorse of a bike. I'm a big fan of the carbon sucking up the bumps but really keeping the torsional flex in check. All things Bontrager.


Weakness:
Some say uncomfortable seat but I haven't had any problems. My girlfriends seat will probably be swapped out by weeks end.


Like most I looked at the lower 1500 model and jumped up to compare. There is no comparison in the two models/frames. My girlfriend purchased the 05 model which costs the same but with a few upgrades. Trek only has the smaller frames available now, my size is a 58cm to be released in late October. I choose to go for the 04 which is a trick looking silver. The 05 is a red front into a white cream rear frame which does look really good. The carbon is still there with a partial red fork. A few upgrades are obviuosly cosmetic, upgraded pods to Ultegra from 105 (good job Trek), the crank is a different finish that is best described as a gun metal and the fork has been sleeked a bit for aerodynamic effects. Both are great rides with a great comfort level. For the price and technology Trek is the way to go for the big name brands. The fact that they own Bontrager doesn't hurt a bit. They put the most into research so let's say thanks to Lance for bring the money in.

I was looking at the 1500 but decided for the money it was worth getting the 2100 with the carbon fork and seatpost. It was well worth it. The bike rides wonderfully. I ride around 60-70 miles per week. I figure I can upgrade the shifters later. The shifters aren't that great. Have to give it a 4 overall rating because of the shifters. But otherwise it's a great bike. I'm very pleased with it.

And the carbon seat stays really do smooth out the ride - they are not just a gimick. I can't comment on the bike's durability, but my initial impressions were very good. Fast and smooth.

Although I have only had this bike for less than a month, I am extremely happy with the ride and handeling. The OCLV seatstay and forks make for a very comfortable ride even on less than perfect roads. I have ridden numerous bikes in trying to decide upon this newest purchase and found the 2100 to be a phenominal deal as far as stock components and ride go for this price. I looked at comprable Giant bikes but found them to be less enjoyable to ride, espesially on distance. This is a great bike and would wholly recommend it to anyone who wants a great bike, without spending a fortune.

Strength:
Smoothe ride. Very upgradable bike. I like the Bontrager parts.


Weakness:
I haven't really found any yet. I'm not real crazy about the seat but seats and pedals are something most people like to change out anyway.


I amazed at how much smoother this bike is than my last all aluminum frame bike. I'm not any faster nor do I climb any better but I don't feel beat up after those long rides. I thought the carbon seatstays were mainly a gimmick and wouldn't make much difference in the ride quality. Was I ever wrong

This bike brings the best of two worlds together. Stiffness of Aluminum and the Comfort of Carbon Fiber. I previously was riding an older 1200 and this bike is a night and day difference. It is just plain fast and climbs like a cat. Wheelset is a big plus, functional and great looking. Carbon seat post is also a major plus. Still comfortable even at the end of a century. For this price no bike is better. Brakes are good even if they have no name.

I also am fairly new to cycling and this is my first road bike. I tested out the 2.1 and 2.3(suprisinigly heavy) Trek bikes and actually enjoy the feel of my 1.5 better. The components are obviously better on the 2.1 and 2.3, but I prefer the stability and overall feel of my 1.5. Being 6'6, 260 I was a little concerned about torque and twisting but so far, so good. Very good beginner/enthusiast road bike, definitely recommended.

Weakness:
If there is a weakness, it might be the straps on the pedals. Difficult to get into while riding at first, but after a couple of rides, it was no problem.


As are many cyclist who purchased this bike, I'm new to cycling. I was thinking about the Specialized Allez, but the LBS did not have it in stock. I went back and tested the 2008 Trek 1.5 double, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. The Alpha Aluminum frame is extremely light. The bike climbs hills with no problem, and the Shimano derailleurs shift smooth and easy. The Bontrager seat is surprisingly comfortable. Great entry level bike. Anyone looking to get into biking, can't go wrong with the Trek 1.5.

Strength:
Lightweight frame (for an aluminium)Looks are sharp.Price


Weakness:
Hard to find from a show room now.


I have had this bike for less than a month and am new to road cycling but this bike suits me down to the ground. I did quite a bit of research on bikes around the £600 mark. My father recently bought a specialized Allez which was cheaper by a little bit.  I have the 08 trek 1.5 and he has the 09 Allez. After comparing the two I found that the 1.5 was noticably lighter than the Allez. I didnt think there'd be much difference.  Granted its not a carbon bike with all the best equipment but for the price its a heck of a deal in my oppinion. Time will tell how well it fairs but as of now i am very impressed.  The aluminium frame's top bar is tapered which reduces weight so i'm told. The 1.5 is easily upgraded because of its weight advantage. Considering the nearest all-carbon bike is priced at £1200 ($2000) this 1.5 seems like a bargain.  The frame is rigid and ride is sharp. When pushed hard there is no deviance in the frame or wheels.   Only problem I had was with the Trek company itself. I had a real problem finding the 1.5 triple (yes a triple, i'm not embaressed) in a 56cm. It seems as though they stop making bikes in preparation for the 09 models coming out in September. So availability was scarce. Coudnt wait till september plus their new models will have a 10%+ price increase!!

Strength: A second season and an updated review. I had an engineer-turned bike mechanic take a look at the bike. He discovered the problem in about 15 minutes: the shifter cables were tangled inside the tube. Fixed. And I stand by my overall rating for this bike. I've been running on GP4000s and the bike is fast enough on flats, and an incredible climber. I live in an area where if you turn left out my drive way you encounter a 3 mile road with an average 10 percent uphill grade. The other direction has an average 9 percent grade uphill. I live with hills and this is the perfect bike for me. It's also very comfortable for longer rides. I've done three centuries with it an average 17 mph, without neck problems. One more thing. I don't care much for the stock wheels so I put some Fulcrums on it.
Weakness: None so far.

Strength: 2021 emonda SL 6 pro vs SLR 7

 I bought the SL 6 pro, and rode it for a couple weeks.  Then I had second thoughts and I tested them back to back on the Los Gatos creek trail (CA) first (2.5 mi out then back on each), then I came back the next day and took just the SLR to hwy 9 in Saratoga where I went 4mi up and 4 down.  These are my thoughts.  


The sl was great but heavy.

The slr 7 was magic.

The slr only really shines when I was climbing longer than .25 miles.  Prior to that, the aerodynamics and momentum made it carry in a similar way to the sl.  But when the SLR was great, it was more vibrant and spritely than anything I’ve ever ridden.   

Neither bike would rub anything when you stand up and sprint. 

I got the impression the ride quality of the slr was more harsh than the sl, but that may have been tire pressure.  I did not verify they were the same.

I could get the slr to lurch forward while seated, spinning cranks with both feet easier, where as the sl, I found myself standing and pulling in order to punch up and move over a hill once the momentum ran out.  Again, weight.  

At about a 4-5% grade, if I’m usually doing 11 on my cervelo, now I was doing 12.4.  At a 7% grade if I was doing 8, now I was doing around 9.6.  But this was only on a 4 mile climb where the first half was like 5% and the second was 7-8%.  And I was pretty stoked, so maybe I was pushing harder than usual.  

Descending, neither impressed.  On the sl, my fastest going down -7% was 42.2 mph, on the slr it was 43.1.  Mind, on my 2013 cervelo r3 with exposed mechanical cables but HED jet 5 wheels (55mm deep) I can consistently hit 45.5 mph.  On shallower grades at around -5% the SLR was doing 28.5mph where I was closer to 30 on my cervelo with hed wheels.  So claims that the new Aeolus pro 37 (and RSL 37 shape for that matter) are about as good as 45mm deep Zipp 303’s I find questionable. 

The ride quality was terrific.  The only time I felt less than comfortable was if I was going down through an underpass at 30+ mph, over lots of cracks.  Then it bounced pretty hard.  But I did ride 50 miles on the SL and I didn’t wish it was cushier.  

I did do a 50 mile ride on the sl.  The weight in the wheels didn’t bother me for the first 20 miles, the next 10 were ambiguous, but the last 20, I did find it hard to get back up to speed and take advantage of that aero in the event I had to slow down for a turn or a stop light or a gust of wind.

Strength: Lots of people around me ride the Domane, and while the idea of that was nice, I really liked the more traditional frame design of the Emonda. The seat mast on the SL and SLR models definitely aids in comfort, but doesn't have the same bobbing effect of the Domane with the decoupler. Addditionally, the lower headtube allows for a more agressive position for race-day or fast flat riding, or a more upright position for longer days in the saddle.

Strength: Great light weight all purpose road bike and not just a climber. Handles all types of roads and has been stable over 50 mph. It is just straight up fun to ride even after 100 miles in the saddle.
Weakness: People complain about the wheelset but I got two sets with mine. I wanted the SL6 pro but it didn't come in red so they sold me the SL6 with the carbon wheels from the pro plus threw in the aluminum wheels for an extra $150. Love the carbon but honestly the aluminum have been worth every penny as spares. I use them on rides with steep descents and have no issues. Bottom line is this was the only bike out of more then 12 that made me want to dump my 25 year old carbon bike with shimano 600.

Strength: Very much like the older Madones of 2009-2011 in performance and handling.  Performance is outstanding and ride is great.
Weakness: This frame was a replacement for an older Madone 5.2 that did not hold up and a manufacturers defect was eventually noted by the bike shop.
So far the bottom bracket does not seem to be the HIGHLY sensitive and maintenance intensive BB of my past Madone.  Still if you are ever caught out in the rain or even do a ride on wet road, plan on removing the BB as soon as possible as water enters it very easily and the bearings will be gone in short order.  If you're not caught out in the rain or you ride only dry roads, plan on overhauling and replacing bearings about twice a year.  The headset, unfortunately, doesn't appear to be as durable a design as my older Madone and the design on the Madone was poor to start with.  Plan on overhauling it once or twice a year and replace at least the upper bearing, if not both, each time.  Again, if you are caught in the rain headset will have to be disassembled and regreased.  When washing my bike I've learned to avoid washing this area and instead clean it with bike cleaner or polish applied to rag and wipe it down.
I don't know whether it is the bike design or the Shimano components but the cable don't last near as long as my previous bikes.  But these same components came over from my other bike.

Strength: Bike is light and nimble without being squirrely.  Excels on hills even with the 34:28 gearing it comes standard with. Feels very stable on fast downhills.  I’ve road on smooth roads, pitted roads, and even a half mile of gravel on my first ride on this bike.  For the price, I’m more than impressed.

Update: 10 months later.

This bike has been constantly in the shop. The front shifter has been a nightmare. The original one failed and was replaced under warranty. Two weeks in the shop. The replacement has had chronic problems and has made rides miserable.  The cheap cable guard under the bottom bracket fell off during a ride; bike has been in the shop for eight days and counting, waiting for the part from Shimano.  I've been riding my fifteen year old Specialized Roubaix (whch is far more reliable than the Emonda) while the emonda the shop and wondering why the hell I didn't just get another Specialized.

Bottom line:  frame is good. Shimano sucks. And given my experience with this bike, I really can't recommend it to anyone else. New rating: two stars for the frame.
Weakness: I wouldn’t consider this a weakness, but the bike would be improved by better wheels, and a 34T cog on the rear cassette. Love this bike.

Strength:
1. Great lightweight climber2. Superb ride comfort, especially on 25c rubber3. H2 Geometry works great for me4. Confidence inspiring handling


Weakness:
1. Wheelset is a weak spot, to be expected at this price-point2. Saddle was terrible for me, my friend has the same one on his Domane 5.2 and likes it 3. Handlebars are meh, the variable radius is not something I like, and I feel cramped in the drops. Will change them out though, this is a personal thing, not really a fault of the bike


This review is for a 2016 TREK Emonda SL6, so not quite the $15,000 SLR10, but a mere mortal $3,000. I've ridden this bike around 700 miles so far, and have been pleased.The 500 series carbon hits what many believe to be the sweet spot for weight/stiffness/cost, between the S and SLR models. The full 6800 Ultegra grouppo works as you'd expect and has needed only minor adjustments to account for initial cable stretch Lots of people around me ride the Domane, and while the idea of that was nice, I really liked the more traditional frame design of the Emonda. The seat mast on the SL and SLR models definitely aids in comfort, but doesn't have the same bobbing effect of the Domane with the decoupler. Addditionally, the lower headtube allows for a more agressive position for race-day or fast flat riding, or a more upright position for longer days in the saddle.  I would not hesitate to recommend this bike to anyone.

Strength:
Upright riding position good for new road bikers, older riders (I'm 55). Ultegra derailleurs, 10 speed 105 cassette, 105 STI shifters/brake handles. Responsive acceleration, good brakes. Carbon components smooth bumpy pavement (I live in Chicago, pothole king of the USA). Very good braking.


Weakness:
Don't particularly like the white paint job. Every speck of dirt or grease makes it look shabby. Saddle is not great (replaced). Didn't like standard pedals much.


This is a LATE 2006 model with the 10spd cassette. Got at closeout at my LBS. It's my first road bike (not counting a Schwinn Continental), previous riding experience is 20 years of hybrids, averaging 5-6000 miles/year.First impression was how light it is. Second impression is responsiveness. I'm a climber, and this baby jumps when you hammer the pedals!Third impression was riding position. I tried the Pilot 2.1 first and liked it a lot. I then tried many other road bikes, some of which I liked, some not so much. By this time I'd forgotten what the Pilot felt like, so I tried it again. No more testing needed. In my price range (up to $1600), nothing else suited me as well.4th Impression: durability. While getting used to clipless pedals for the first time, it's gone down 4 times, once HARD (helmet cracked, 8 in. bruise on hip, scraped hand, knee & shoulder). Well, took it in to the shop, only repairs needed were readjustments! Now that's quality. And I had them check EVERYTHING.5th impression: Best mix of components/frame for this price I found. Others had either inferior drivetrains with carbon frame, or cheap brakes, or abberant geometry, or jarring aluminum ride.

Strength:
For the price range, this bike offers great components and a lot of carbon. The white paint and black graphics look very smooth.


Weakness:
The seat. No secret there. Also switching to a more Road-suitable pedal than the SPD's will greatly affect your ability to get your energy to the pavement.


I have the 2006 Trek Pilot 2.1. This is my first road bike, but I have been riding MTB for over 10 years. I decided to make the switch to increase my abilities on my MTB and for the differentiated workout. I am a bigger rider, 6' 215 LBS, and this bike has been great so far. The Ultegra components that come on the bike are awesome for the price range of this bike. Although I am a larger rider for a road bike, I have had no issues with the components or frame and the amount of carbon on the bike provides a very smooth ride. I would recommend this bike to anyone looking at an entry level bike, but can afford to spend a little more and get a bike that will last. Also, given my frame, the relaxed Pilot geometry is very comfortable. I test road the Trek 2100 (very similar) but the geometry of this bike is designed for someone that may not be accustomed to the committed riding position. I rode the bike for a while with the included SPD's because people told me they would be fine. Listen to the Road riders! Get a more suitable pedal platform and deliver more of your energy to the pavement!

Strength:
Comfortable ride with a more upright position. It really dampens the road buzz.Good saddle for my b_tt.I like the guidoline feel too.


Weakness:
I think it should be sold without the pedals; the pedals included are on the heavy and clumsy side.I had a bit of rust showing up here and there on bolts and parts (I, believe it or not, sometime enjoy riding in rain).The top bearing of the headset came apart and had to be fixed up. LBS did a quick and good job on that one.Front headset tend to stick when riding near or below freezing point making it diffult to keep a straight trajectory (kind of a hinged frame sensation).


It is my first true road bike. So far I am very satisfied with it. I replaced the pedals for clip pedals (a must I think). After about 1500km, I replaced the wheels for something lighter and more stiff (Neuvation R28 Aero). It improved an already good ride and made the bike more dynamic. I also changed the Bontrager Race lite tires by Bontrager Race lite triple case to keep the flat tires at bay but with mitigous success.

Strength:
The overall ride is really good for a $1300 bike. Stable steering that takes broken pavement well. Paint and welds are above average. Versatility w/ fenders and larger tires. I am enjoying the bike a lot.


Weakness:
Trek cuts off the steerer tube too short on a 63cm to 285mm which causes one to use a stem with a steep rise. Cane Creek SCL 3 long reach brakes are spongy.


2006 Trek 2.1 w/ upgraded 105 50x39x30 crankset. You attach ""comfort"" to any roadbike and others want to label it a hybrid or some type of cushy ""middle aged persons"" bike. This is a performance road bike. I flip my stem over and it looks like any other performance road bike. The real ""comfort"" with this bike is the relaxed geometry meaning the bike is very stable and no twitchiness. It is a little slow going into a curve but the upside is that the margin of error is better. Being a steel fan, I have been pleased with the ride. I think the ride is smooth due to the 25c tires, longer wheelbase, bzzkill inserts and carbon fork. I don't know if the carbon stays make a difference though. This is a great ""one bike"" bike. I will be able to run fenders in the winter plus I can run bigger tires for the broken pavement in early spring.

Strength:
Upright seating position makes this bike easy on the back and hands. Easy to go long and fast.


Weakness:
Still growing accustomed to the saddle.


Bought this bike to replace my Fuji Touring after I was broad-sided by a pick-up truck in November. Wanted a step up in technology over the steel frame without braking the bank or rattling my teeth. The carbon fork and seat stays keep the road buzz down, easily as comfortable as my steel Touring. Looked at buyng another Fuji Touring or the Specialized Sequoia Elite, but Pilot had better wheels then the Sequoia and was a giant step-up over the Touring for only $200.

A great bike frame for my middle-aged frame. Very comfortable for my moderate paced recreational riding style. More up-right position and the carbon really suits my needs.

Strength:
Light weight; carbon seat post; gearing; carbon fork and seat stay. Upright seating!


Weakness:
Better seat.......but that is with any bike you buy!


With the upright seating I can stay longer on the bike as compared to conventional road bikes. I use to get lower back pain from my old bike but no longer with the Pilot 2.1! The ZR9000 Al frame is a plus with the carbon seat stay it makes rear tire jolt minimal! The higher end gearing you get for the money is a great addition. This bike is a bargain for the price and as compared to Giant, a better bike in my opinion. This is my second road bike; my first was a mail order Windsor Bristol which was okay for entry level but the Pilot by TREK is a lifelong bike.

Strength:

Weakness:
Stock Chain (Shimano) rusted very badly from the beginning.


This is my first road bike. Up to this time I have been riding mtn bikes. Wanted to do a cycling trip with my son so made the switch. Looked at Giants and the Trek 1200C. Really liked the Pilot 2.1 much better than the 1200C. I am a large person and was concerned about possible wheel/spoke problems but I have had no problems other than one flat even with some bumpy broken pavement and long rides (100k). I don't have much to compare it to in road bikes but for a beginner, particularly someone looking for a more upright posture it is a very nice bike. The stock chain rusted very badly so I have replaced it with a SRAM 990 which also helps with keeping the drive components clean.

I bought this bike because I have ambitions of racing, and I don't think it will let me down. It feels very fast, stiff, and light. I upgraded the wheels to Velomax Circuit, which made a HUGE difference. I also added an Arione saddle and Speedplay pedals. I did a lot of research before purchasing, and found this to be the best bike at this price point.

Strength:
High quality frame, Ultegra 10, Strong wheels, Needs no uprades!


Weakness:
Not the most exotic or exiting frame and parts, but a solid performer nonetheless.


This is a review of the 2005 Trek 2300 (Double).
I bought this bike a few months ago as an upgrade from an older Steelman w/ DA 9. While my former bike was high quality, it did not offer the advances in technology that the newer bikes offer (10 spd., carbon fork, carbon stays, etc.)
My riding routine consists of 3-4 rides a week (150-200 mi.). I am a former racer, and I do try to keep reasonable speeds and averages. The 2300 suits me very well for my budget (Graduate Student).
I rode several other bikes before finally going with this one. My primary reason for my choice was that this bike had the geometry and fit that worked best with my body (5'9"", short legs). Specifically, this bike accomodates my need for a shorter reach. This is achieved by the 2300's straighter seat tube angle and slightly shorter top tube.
The bike's frame is high quality without a crazy price tag. I definitely appreciate the carbon stays to take the edge off. Also, I've noticed very little flex towards the BB or other areas.
The bike comes equipped very well with a complete Ultegra 10 group (very nice!) and solid, albeit somewhat unexciting, Bontrager house parts. The wheels in particular came highly recommended and appear to be very strong. They have stayed true despite many miles and rough roads. Also, the seat suprisingly has turned out to work very well. I tried a Fizik Arione for 85 mi., and the stock Bont. Race Lite Lux was much better.
There are very few weaknesses with this bike for the price point. In fact, now that I think of it - I have no real complaints. This is a very solid bike and needs no immediate upgrades.

Seems to be some vertical flex on undulating, as opposed to rough or steady, surfaces (i.e., after a sequence of bumps, it sometimes feels like the frame is squishing up and down), which makes me think it's not the best choice for sprinters.

Holy S#%* this bike is fast. I've been riding mountain bikes the past three years and wanted to try out the road. I have already put on 500 miles on this bad boy and I have no complaints. This is by far the best ride out there for the money. I demo'ed others but none of them compared. I'm amazed at the smooth ride I get every time I get on it.

I bought this bike used off of Ebay, after the original owner had used it for about 2 months. It is in beautiful shape, and I got lucky to pay about 55% of what it costs new. The new carbon seatstays are impressing me with their smoothness. I have done mainly trainer rides on it, but I have also done 5 or 6 road rides on it, with a century just last weekend. It is a nice ride.

Strength:
reliable, fun, can mount rack


Weakness:
None for my purposes


I bought a 2007-ish Trek 1000 used for $350, and I was a little worried because I had been warned about the shifters and had generally heard mixed things about the bike. But I couldn't be happier. I've used it pretty much every day for a year, for commuting over crappy roads (including in rain and snow), as well as for short bike camping treks. It's fantastic. I try to take care of it, but I certainly don't baby it--I've never taken it to a shop--and the shifters are just fine. By that I mean they work, every time. That's about all I look for in a shifter, so if your tastes are more refined you might feel differently, I really don't know. I'm even still riding the original tires, which were fine when I got the bike (it was somebody's weekend road ride for several years), but they need changing after this last year of abuse. As far as I'm concerned, this is a great middle ground between hard core road bike and practical commuter--unlike a lot of other road bikes, you can put a rack on this one (I have one that I use for groceries and camping trips, and it beats a backpack). But it still cut my commute time in half when I switched from an old mountain bike. It's tough enough to handle serious potholes without feeling like it's going to break, and light enough for me to maneuver easily in my tiny apartment. I'm sure those with real road racing ambitious are skeptical for a reason, but I'd buy it again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone looking for a solid commuter bike. Keep in mind that both front and back wheels are quick release (at least they are on my model), so either consider switching them or make sure you get a lock that can secure everything.

He is a very nice person and is always attentive to the needs of his customers. Sanjib is also very funny and after this experience we became a very good friend. Next year at the end of January I will return for the third time in Nepal and Sanjib will be again my guide. For these reasons I am very glad to report all references of Sanjib  Sarah and Ryan from Perth wrote in 2012We have just returned from trekking the everest region in Nepal. It was our first time traveling to Nepal and our first experience trekking. We contacted our guide, Sanjib Adhakari after reading reviews from his previous clients and it was the best decision we made. Sanjib made our whole experience much easier and more enjoyable! From regular contact before our trip, to booking hotels and flights for us, organizing our holiday was a very effortless experience. Sanjib is not only very knowledgable and experienced at trekking, he has a great sense of humour that makes even those longer days walking more fun! I would highly recommend Sanjib and have actually already begun organizing our next trek with him.Feel free to contact me at [email protected] if you would like to know anything else or contact Tracy Samassa wrote in 2012 I have just completed Mount Everest Base Camp trek. I decided not to go in a group, but just with a guide. I was recommended Sanjib Adhikari and contacted him 2 months before my intended departure. From the first time I made contact, he was so responsive. He answered all my questions and gave me all the advice and help I needed even before getting to Nepal. Nothing was too much for him.I was travelling alone, and worried I might get lonely for so long. Sanjib could not do enough to make my trek a happy and successful one. Everything went exactly as planned, he was 100% honest and reliable and is very knowledgeable about the Nepal, trekking, the areas and the people.He also speaks very good English and has a good sense of humour. Not only was the trip a success but he made it enjoyable and a memorable one.I would highly recommend any potential trekker in Nepal use Sanjib Adhikari.

This bike has saved my life when things were rough. It was my introduction to road biking. I can't say enough about this bike, Trek really does a great service to the bike culture, offering a very strong frame, and good components. Snot nosed rich kids will criticize the Sora componentry, and it is Shimano's entry level line, so upgrades can be pleasant however it is very sufficient, and regardless if this is your first road bike or you have been in the game for a longer term, you can take this bike home feeling good about your purchase.

This bike is fantastic for the price paid. As Trek's entry level bike it is not the best thing money can buy, but it is far from the worse. I ride it almost every day to my job 10 miles away, ride it back another 10, and occasionally will do a long ride (100+ miles). I recently did one up to Cleveland from Pittsburgh. It does get a lot of flats although, riding through Pittsburgh's bad roads kill me.

Ultra light aluminum frame. Eats the hills up. I am primarilly a runner but this bike fits the bill. The wheels are true. Just bought profile aero bars for tri.s. Very pleased.

Weakness:
Shifters are tabs and brake levers so constantly changing hand positions.


I got this bike to try road cycling. I am hooked. Put in 3000 miles the first year. Very good beginners bike with 3rd front ring. Nice to know its there if you run into some steep hills. Stiff frame to build on. Upgrades can always be put on better frame if you like riding. I would recommend this bike if your on a tight budget and are looking for the most for the money.

Strength:
Stiff frame, easy ride, great entry level bike. If you want to upgrade it is well worth it. Durable and cool colors. Responsive and good grometry.


Weakness:
Stock components good for only around town and not for hills. Saddle is terrible and the Sora thumb shifter tend to break easily.


Bought the Trek 1000sl Flare Duotone after using neighbors Specialized Allez in a Local Tri. Stock the bike is great for entry level riders who ride 50 miles or less. Saddle is junk, and components are ok for short daily riding or commuting. Love the stiffness for climbing and comfortable ride. After upgrading components the bike handles better then a 2500 or newer 2.5 and is comparable to igher end aluminum bikes. Bike now weighs in @ 19.25 pounds I will have this bike for a long long time!!!

Bought a Trek 1000 05.This Bike is very good. It is very solid riding and quick considering it's a 8 cog. I just changed out those heavy, crappy tires and added neuvations with kevlar tires along with ti skewers. Shaved about 1 lb and added a much smoother spin and gained a few rpms. Added aero bars and a carbon post.If looks matters (not cost), add those rims.

Absolutely amazing bike for the price. I bought it used, but even new it doesn't even get near the 1k mark. I've been riding this for a few months now, and I love it most of the time, except for flats often, which is why I would strongly recommend a new set of rims. Handles great, brakes well, and takes the abuse of downtown streets. I've gone down Joaquin Miller Road on this bike, topping 45 mph and felt completely secure.

Strength:
Price is right for basic road bike. Nice paint and style for base model. For entry level bike people tell me how nice it looks all the time???... Easy to get parts and most shops can work on them. After riding in the rain the water did not rust the bike much and after wiping it down it was ready to go.


Weakness:
The tires are not great quality and will need to be replaced after many miles. It is easy to knock out the rims and they will need to be replaced with any hard riding. I found the new seat on the lastest models kind of funny, so I replaced it will a leather seat off the 03 model.


I am riding a orange trek sl(super light) 1000 right now. I have had three trek 1000s in the last 6 years and they are good road bikes for the money. I put about 1000-2000 miles on them before they start needing work. The 2007 has the carbon fork and seat post which makes it a little lighter but not as stable for me. They down graded the seat quality when the carbon was added to the bike and it makes it feel cheaper to me than the older models. Over all for the money they are great bikes for the weekend rider and if you can pick one up a used one in good shape it is the way to go for entry level rider. If you are buying it used make sure it has low miles and the rims are straight!

Strength:
Stiff, good for the price, and one of the best intro road bikes.


Weakness:
The front derailleur can be a little tricky to get used to since it comes with a triple chain ring, makes some noise when shifting. Tires may also need replacement after your first 500 miles or so.


If you're looking to get into road cycling this is probably the best one to get. I bought the bike end of '06. As a stock model, it was perfect, I had no problems with any of it's components, and as long as you maintain it, it should last for a long time. This was my introductions to road cycling, so I was looking for an entry level bike, tested a few others but the stiffness, looks and handling convinced me that this was the bike to buy. Now over the last two years I've eventually upgraded most of its components, but the frame still holds. For the price you can't go wrong.

Strength:
Overall, there are no real ""strengths"" to the bike, but you get a good bang for your buck.


Weakness:
The seat is fine for beginners, but it is a little big for my preference.The nylon strap pedals will start to hurt if you're on the bike a lot.The bike is kinda of heavy; somewhere about 21.5 dry.THE WHEELS! If you can get a different set of wheel somewhere for a pretty good price, please replace the stock ones. One last thing, the brake that came with the bike were a little too short on the front and caused the pads to rub the tire. Trimming the pads down a little bit will get you around the problem, but you lose some of your stopping power.


I bought this bike for my first bike since I was on a budget. I heard this was the best entry level bike for the money, and I'll have to agree. If you're just starting out and you need a decent bike at a decent price, this is the bike to get.

The trek 1000 is a great entry level bike. I tested a number of other bikes in the price range and I liked this one best, it seemed to be the fastest and have a best components for the price. I have so far put 3000 miles on it and have had no problems that couldn't easily be fixed. It has really got me interested in the sport. I give it 4/5 because of the lack of STI shifting but I guess you get what you pay for.

Weakness:
Noisy. Stock saddle made my butt hurt. Stock wheels are heavy (I did go over a year without a flat, though).


This bike was my introduction to road riding. It must have done something right, because I did fall in love with road riding. Given the fact it was my first bike, some things may not have been great, but for the most part I was none the wiser anyway. The shifting could be rough at times. Also, it made lots of random noises--the handlebars creaked, the chain rattled, the deraileurs crackled. I ordered the bike off ebay, which I discovered was the wrong way to go about things, but, oh well. I feel for the money spent, this entry level bike does exactly what it's supposed to do--get you into riding without spending a ton of money. From there, you can either upgrade or quit.

Weakness:
FDWheelsSaddleBrakesGeometryMakes some strange noises!


I'd heard the trek 1000 was the best bet for an entry level road bike and after 1200 miles it's proved more than acceptable for the price. The carbon forks and seatpost are a plus and the frame is good. The bike is a fast, exciting ride and is definitely worthy of upgrades for the advancing rider. The tyres don't look too good and I have heard people saying how useless they are. However, they grip fine and haven't punctured yet, which is good considering some of the terrain they cross.   The wheels are heavy and both were badly out of true when I bought the bike new. However, after repair, they have withstood some pretty rough treatment. Shifting on the 1000 is OK as long as you understand it. I am able to shift with sora on the drops so no problems there. However it can be clunky and imprecise but that's what you expect for a bike of this price. The FD is sh 2200 and is awful but if you get used to you can get by. The RD is OK but can slip (planning to upgrade to 105 all round). The brakes are un-branded and don't feel confident + the pads get eaten up very quickly. The stock saddle looks soft and comfortable but even on short rides proved to be very painful. The upgrade to the harsh-looking specialized toupe increased comfort no end. Finally, the agressive geometry of the bike can make for a punishing ride. I experienced a lot of lower back pain but found shortening the stem by 10mm helped. If you prefer a more forgiving ride which doesn't force you into a flat back position then go for a trek pilot or one of the new 08 models. Overall a great bike to get me into the sport but there are plenty of other great value entry-level bikes out there so shop around.

Strength:
- Looks great- Rides really well- Fairly light for the price- Carbon fork and seatpost


Weakness:
- Front derailleur is a piece of garbage, and will require a lot of adjustment to keep you shifting smoothly.- If, like me, you live in a fairly flat region, the smallest chainring is useless. Ditching it for a double in front would probably smoothe out the shifting a lot.- Stock tires aren't very good, and wear out quickly.- Wheels could stand to be upgraded.


All in all, this is a great entry-level starter bike. The carbon post and fork are a nice surprise in this price range, and the bike looks fantastic in the flare duotone. The only real problem is that the components can be kind of finicky.

Strength:
PRICE!!!, solid frame, great ride Highly recommend to entry riders or riders who don't want to spend a small fortune on a bike. (I work for a living)


Weakness:
stock tires, big deal replace in the first 300 miles.


I rate this all 5 for the unbeatable price to quality ratio. Purchased in early summer and average 130 miles per week. Riden approximately 1200 miles (so far) Replaced the stock tires with Michelin, no other changes. Components all work great with a little mainenance. Have riden on many group rides including the Going Green Century from Salida Colorado to the summit of Cottonwood pass (12,128 feet) and back. Topped out with speeds in excess of 50mph on the descent, steady as a rock and cornered perfectly. Passing many higher priced bikes. No problem keeping up with bikes 2 and 3 times more expensive with riders of similar physical levels. Bike has never been the reason for me getting droped from a group ride. I have riden in 3 mile time trials with times under 8 minutes with no upgrades to the bike except for the tires. Love this bike Plan to upgrade wheels from stock this winter.

Weakness:
The chain is so noisy I can hear it over my ipod! Dealer has tried repeatedly to adjust it properly without success and I think they are getting tired of seeing me/blowing me off because I bought entry level and expect it to work. The original Bontrager tires were junk. I was constantly getting flats. Thorns, glass, small rocks, and even when the next door neighbor would sneeze my tire would go flat. Replaced with Armadillos, problem solved although the ride is a bit harsh. Still a dramatic improvement over having to walk home.


It's light. It's fast. It's cute. It's comfortable. I had not been on a road bike in 30 years, rode this one around the block and came back to the store grinning from ear to ear. It's infectious and I was hooked.I ride too and from work (12 mile round trip) and recrationally, typically 30 miles or so on my day off and I have over 450 miles on it now - with no breakdowns whatsoever (aside from flats mentioned below).

Strength:
- Inexpensive- Large dealer network.- Good Frame. Good Geometry, handles good in a straight line won't wobble as easily as high end bikes- Can be used for touring. Rack eyelets. Most don't have this. Good alternative to Trek 520.- Components are cheap, but can be replaced with higher quality ones once the y wear out. If that happens, you save money by keeping the frame, if not, the bike didn't cost much, and can be resold more easily.- Good sleeper. I can keep up with most people with much better bikes when on the MUP, but don't have clipless pedals, and don't run red lights.


Weakness:
-Poor dealer setup, too loose, not enough loctite.-Tires are garbage (no puncture reistantce at all, very thin)-Stock brake pads eat up the rims really fast, embeded aluminum filings wear down the rim in no time. - No clear coat.


Bought it one month old off Craig's list. I think the previous owner scratched the rear derailleur and couldn't return it, hence sold it.  I've probably put about 5000+ km in the 8 months that I've had it. Usually do a 100 km ride on nice days. Commute about 30 km one way. I rode it through all the snow storms this past winter, a few showers, and it's still going. Having nothing to rust beats most most department store and used bikes you see people riding around on down town. I've had a several light crashes on this bike, it's held up quite well, only bar tape and britfer scratches that are hardly noticeable. Paint job gets looks from people with bike five times the price. Bike looks nice from some angles. The effect on the paint makes it look nicer than it really is. Would be nicer with a clear coat so it doesn't show wear. The derailleur system is what it is. The cables do stretch and cause the system to be off after a month. If it's dialed in, it works quite well. The front derailleur is not the best, but works well if you have it dialed in. Keep it clean as the wheels kick alot of dirt on it. Here's the big tip alot of owners seem to be missing. When up shifting the front dérailleur, push and hold the shifter all the way in until the dérailleur has engaged the chain. This will push the dérailleur a bit further than just the click point, allowing the chain to engage more easily. Make sure your limit screw is not set to tight as this will also make it hard to get into the high gear, and stop you from using the tip. Also be sure to use the down tube cable tensioners to correct for cable stretch every month or so. When down-shifting onto the granny gear, you can push the shifter in to wear you begin to feel the resistance of the first click, this is basically wear the brifter begin to take up cable slack, hold and push the button. Now slowly release the shifter. The derailleur doesn't jerk as much and won't drop the chain. Similar to previously mentioned tip above. Lube the plastic guide plate under your bottom bracket and keep your front derailleur clean for better shifting. That cable guide is what causes most of the resistance and roughness you feel when upshifting. Put grease underneath the cables, and then clean any exposed grease to stop dirt.  The the metal around the o-ring, on the cable adjustment on the front brakes, can hit and cause a scratch on your frame if you let the handle bar swing all the way to the right. I suspect part of the performance issues might be due to the fact that Trek ships this bike with longer than optimal cable housings. Consider trimming them according to the guide Sheldon Brown has posted on his website, and ensure the cables are lubed properly. Ensure you have both sets of water bottle screws installed. Mine doesn't have the ones on the downtube, allowing water entry into the frame. The frame is completely sealed otherwise, except for the holes on the back of the chain stays. I've put quite a bit of wear and tear on the rear dérailleur and right shifter. I shift fairly often due to traffic and lights and down shift every time I stop yet wear is not noticeable. I lubricate the derailleur with only and the swivel joints and it keeps it running smoothly. I've have had an issue with the plastic shifter handles loosening from the metal part its screwed into, which causes the shifters to rattle, and be loose back and forth when not holding the breaks, and rub against the plastic underneath. A little loctite and pushing the shifter all the way in to screw it in resolves that. I've had my right pedal loose the dust cap and the strap break a month and a half ago, and it's still going. Consider getting clipless pedals and an updrage to the 1500 or Shimano 105, if your going to ride seriously.  I suspect the reason most other owners have had problems is due to same reason I have. Simple maintenance neglect. Keept it lubed, clean, and well adjusted and your Trek 1000 will run great.

Strength:
Great starter bike with room to grow (replace individual components as necessary). Price is very fair, and trek always gives quality above and beyond expectation.


Weakness:
color scheme and decals have always been a little loud, so I stripped it bare.Heavy... but for 600 bones who cares.


I bought this bike in '03 for a US tour, and put 4000 miles on it in the first 3 months. No real issues other than some broken spokes. Put about 11,000 miles on the stock components. This bike has grown with me for 4 years and lots of miles. Frame is still going strong. I am giving it 5's across the board, not because it is the best road bike, but because it is the best in its class.

Great bike for the price. I was amazed to find that as an entry level road bike, this bike is light and fast. Once you start pedaling, the bike just doesn't want to stop moving. In 4 months with this bike, I put just over 700 miles. Loved the bike/sport so much that I'm hoping to upgrade to an Orbea with campy components.

Bought this bike to see if I would like cycling and I fell in love with the sport and the bike. For the price you can't beat the performance. My bike is not the same as it was when I bought it, I've done quite a few upgrades in the 17 months that I've owned it. It has served me well and I would suggest looking no further than this bike if you are just getting into road biking.

Strength:
Good colour scheme, OK brightness during the day, though will need plenty reflective tape for better safety at night. 50 cm frame is nice and stiff. You can feel every once of effort going into propulsion. The triple is a must for anyone wanting to do hills at a recreational level. The spread of gears also means that you tend not to be stuck on a handful of gears and wearing those cogs out in a short period of time.  Being able to lift the bike over your head.


Weakness:
The rider.  Big size gap from 43 cm frame to 50 cm frame. I would have preferred a 48 cm bike and I am 166 cm tall. If I knew about the Giant OCR 3 at the time of purchasing, I probably would have gone for that. Removed the cage pedals as soon as the bike arrived home. Front triple needs to treated with care during shifting to prevent the chain falling off.  Deraileurs needs to be fine tuned or checked every 3 months to get the very best out of them.  Shimmy in front wheel after 100 km. Front wheel bearings need tightening. Fixed at first free service. Brake pads disintegrate quickly in the wet. I lost 2 mm of pads on the front and rear in the ’06 Sydney gong ride major decents. Handlebar tape constantly slipping out of place. Front and rear derailers needed major adjustment at 14 months. Tyre tread burned off after an emergency stop from 35 km/h. Ready to get some kevlars.


Great entry level bike: for those not wanting to spend the lots of money and just wants something to give you the pleasure of riding road bike.  The bike wants you to keep riding. If treated with care and serviced well, the bike will serve you well.

This is a high quality entry level bike. Great value, decent components, comfortable, and fun to ride. However, if you are looking for a bike to get out and be competitive with, this is definitely not it. The bike is very flexy and almost feels like you are fighting the bike at higher speeds. Rims also get out of true quite easily. Decent bike, but not a racer for sure.

Great looks and a few upgrades make it look and ride awesome.

After 28 years on a Takara, I picked up my Flare Duotone Trek 1000 yesterday from the LBS (Local BS er). Asked them to give the bike a thorough going over before I picked it up. Nonetheless, the tires weren't even fully inflated when I picked it up. First ride, the thing squeeked and didn't shift right. I've seen the last of that dealer. Repacked the bearings and adjusted the front derailleur and now is rideable. Can't get the chain to go to the small front chainring, but I won't use it anyway. After looking at Specialized, Kona, and Giant I decided on this bike because it has a 63cm frame and a long 17 degree stem. Other LBS said I should have 61cm frame but the 63cm felt right. I can stretch out on this bike and it feels great.

The stock shifters, front and rear derailurs, brakes are garbage. All shimano Tigara. The front is especially bad, too much grinding on the upshift, the rear ALWAYS needs to be adjusted. I immediately upgraded to Ultegra parts which were spendy but totally worth it performance wise.


This is an excellent all around road bike. I've checked out $2500 road bikes and this frame compares very nicely.

Carbon forkGreat looks and good paintValue for money


Weakness:
Front derailleur very disappointingSaddle - depending on personal taste


This is my first road bike in some time, having ridden my all-purpose hard-tail mountain bike for the last 12 years.  The Trek 1000 represented great value as a starter road bike to get back in to club rides and middle distance work. I found the bike to be well built, stable and comfortable from the start. The carbon front fork is particularly impressive in soaking up road vibration and worse. The wheels have stood the intial test of rough local roads and do not show any signs of going out of true yet. That said, there are some components you should upgrade almost immediately. As documented elsewhere, the front derailleur is disappointing and regularly drops the chain during changes. Fortunately the rear derailleur performs flawlessly. Not surprisingly on a bike at this price point the saddle and pedals are also components that are better upgraded. The former is well padded which helps with the bumps in the road but the lack of anatomical shape will make you pay in different ways.

1) Killer paint job! The two-tone Flare (orange and gold) is the coolest ever! 2) Carbon fiber fork and seatpost smooth it out a little3) Shifter assemblies integrated into the brake lever handles is very sharp4) Overall geometry is good, comfortable ride5) Did I mention the gorgeous paint?


Weakness:
1) Front derailleur is garbage2) Stock tires are dangerously bad3) Trek support on shifting problem has been disappointing, to say the least


Overall, a great entry level bike, but not without some notable problems. The stock tires were the worst I've ever had, with eight flats and one blowout in the first six weeks. Bontrager RaceLite hardcase tires with kevlar liners to the rescue!  The main problem has been the front derailleur. Won't shift up without excessive grinding, but can be adjusted so that it won't shift down, either. My dealer called Trek, found that they know about the problem, and Trek offered me a $30 credit toward a fix. Since a new chainring will cost a bit over $100, their offer is unacceptable.

Strength:
For bikes at this price point, the Trek 100 cannot be beat. The granny gear up front helps work all the hills in my town too.


Weakness:
The front derailleur is a bit particular. When upshifting, you have to hold the lever a little long than would be expected. Sometimes the upshifts misfire.


It's my first road bike, and I absolutely love it. I'm closing in on 500 miles after about 3 months of riding. The carbon fiber fork and seat post are nice touches. The geometry is perfect - at least for my size and shape. After many hours and miles, my body pains are minimal to none. Fortunately I haven't had one flat yet.

Strength:
Overall value. A very good entry level bike for the money from a reputable name. Smooth riding. Triple chain rings are handy for the steep hills in the area.


Weakness:
Stock wheel set needed truing at about 1000 miles. Stock tires puncture easily. Front derailleur is clumsy.


The 1000SL is my first road bike. I test rode it and a 1500, but liked the paint job and price of the 1000 better. I was not sure how much I would ride, so I wanted to limit my investment. Overall I am pleased with the bike. I get a lot of compliments on the paint job. For the first 2500 miles I had no problems with the shifting, but now with 3100 miles it needs more frequest tweaking. The rear derailleur works fine, the front derailleur is not very smooth. Brakes are adequate. I really appreciate the carbon fork and seat post. The bike is comfortable for up to 3 hrs (about 45 to 50 miles), after that it begins to beat you up a bit. I replaced the stock tires after my fourth flat in the first 1200 miles. I am now using Bontrager RaceLites with kevlar, no flats period. I added clipless pedals. Overall a good bike. The LBS (Lee's in Tulsa"" has bee GREAT to buy from and deal with.

Carbon fork, optional triple, good brakes, great variety of paint jobs


Weakness:
Shifters are Shimano basic level; Wheels are heavy and sometimes wobbly; stock tires are cheap


Great bike for the ""trial by fire"" introduction into road racing. I bought a 1000, because I was not sure how much I would like road biking. The 1000 gives riders a strong entry-level bike but it is too heavy to make anyone into a racer overnight. I have ridden on more than 100 rides on this bike and I still love it. For less than $700.00, a beginning road rider can not go wrong with a 1000. Within a year and riding against full carbon frames, one might want to trade up, but Trek's basic bike is lots of fun and a great value for your money. The color choices are fantastic, I have the Orange one.

Strength:
the stuff that has trek and bontrager's name on them. the frame is nice and solid, the bontrager carbon fiber accents (seat post and fork) do there job nicely, and look good. not the bontrager tires though, haha, they're a joke...


Weakness:
the stuff with shimano and alex's name on them... endless problems with the entire shifting process. the front derailier is absolute garbage (it seems to have something against the big ring, because it often times won't shift into it) the alex rims, though probably pretty strong, are just on the bike to keep the price down. that's all they're good for... ah yes, and the tires aren't 'performance minded' by any definition.


This was my first experience with an 'actual' road bike, and it helped me learn a bunch. So probably a good bike for beginners, such as I was. Some things I learned: You get what you pay for, even if $600 seems like a lot, it's not... bottom of the line bike with bottom of the line components, hard as it may try, can't keep up with someone who's gonna actually 'use' the bike. Oh yes, and better wheels make a HUGE difference. Though I have some gripes, I can't deny that helped me mature as a cyclist, and learn most everything I need to about riding. Call it a good ""launchpad"" maybe.

Strength:
Excellent frame...wonderful color (orange-red-yellow). Nice and light entry level frame.


Weakness:
stock wheels are not as strong as they could have been. I have crashed twice due to the weakness in the spokes and rims...once with my friend due to a miscommunication and in the second time in my FIRST race, when a rider cut me short and totally ripped out my spokes, causing me to crash out of the race with pretty bad road rash.


Absolutely wonderful bike. I got this bike for Christmas in 2005 and it was an at least 500% improvement from the piece of crap I was on before I got it (previous bike was an old steel windsor that was probably 35-45 lbs.) 22lb's is a huge improvement in both handling and the overall ride quality. I loved the bike so much in the first few months, that I recommended my dad get one for my mom for valentine's day. It is an absolutely wonderful entry level road bike and couldn't be a better value. I do have to say, the frame was not done justice when the cruddy sora shifters were put on. They got it right with the tiagra derailer, but it should have had the tiagra shifters and front derailer on it.

Strength:
Frame and fork are responsive. The ride is stiff but not too rough. Derailer is a notch above the similar priced bikes. Cant do much better without dropping a couple grand. Bike felt great flying down hills at 45-50 mph around bends in the back roads.


Weakness:
If this is your first road bike and you end up getting serious about riding, youll outgrow the 1000 after the first thousand miles. Chain has derailed a few times when I was going uphill, in fact on the same spot of the mountain on two separate occasions. It fell off and got jamed between the crank and bottom bracket, peeling a chunk of paint off the frame. The dropout has bent on me as well. The bike has never been so much as dropped and five months after use I had to replace it. Around the same time I needed to fix the headset and true the wheels– big time.  The at 450 rims also began to chip early on around the area where the brakes contact.


For the money I couldnt have dont any better. Ive ridden this bike with friends on much more expensive bikes through the back country and technology-wise, the only reason why Id ever get left behind would be because of user error.

Ride feel, shifting, agility, and durability.


Weakness:
The stock saddle is only comfortable for a short period of time. I replaced it quickly. The tires wear quickly and flat easily. Some aluminum wore off the machined rims into the brake pads early on.


This is an outstanding bike for the price. It is nimble, responsive, and relatively light. It is a joy to ride. The wheels are basically indestructible and stay true (although this contributes to a large portion of the bikes weight). The derailleurs shift smoothly and the paint (silver, gunmetal, blue) looks great.

Strength:
Very light frame. Affordable compared to everything else. The newer models include a carbon fork and post which was long overdue.


Weakness:
Aluminum is bone jarring. Components need more tweeking than should be necessary.


This is for the red-white and blue 2001 model. Commuted to work for 300 miles then gave it up b/c of too many dogs on my commuter route. Picked it back up last fall and have really enjoyed riding again. Since my 20 yr old truck blew its oil seals, this is my ride to work. I've ridden 500 miles since knee surgery Aug 3rd. I put a 50t ring on front and a 13-26 cassette on the back. Some thick bar tape is a must unless you like numb hands and arms. Before the Bar Phat tape I had to shift hand postion very frequently. This bike is a good all round ride. Don't stand while shifting and you'll have no problems with the drive train.  I plan on purchasing a carbon frame bike: Can anyone say ORCA! But this will still be my main ride.I can't emphasize enough...Bar Phat Tape!

Great entry level road bike. (From what I hear and from the little experience I have had with it.)Can handle moderate abuse.Good Frame.Fast. Light. All around good bike.


Weakness:
Shifters are stiff, no comparison to my XT setup on my MTB.Cage style pedals suck as always.(They left the bike before it left the shop.)Wheels could be a little better but whatever, i stay away from curbs and potholes. No out of trueness yet. Would like some higher psi tires but I will eventually replace them anyway. Derailleurs are not the best but it is entry level, I will probably upgrade the tiagra shifters and deralliurs to at least Ultegra next spring. Probably Upgrade the rims too. This isn't unusual to me because really, the frame is the important part and I will have this bike blowing the 1500 model away in less than a few months.


This is actually a 2006.. Anyhow..  The first thing I fell in love with was the paintjob. It's called Flare Duotone, its friggin hot. Anyhow, This is my first road bike ever and I was a straight mountain/cross country cyclist.. I had started commuting 40 miles a day to work so I decided the 2.24 tires had to go but I still needed to hit the trails whenever I pleased. Problem solved - purchased road bike. I like the bike because of its simplicity and how fast it is compared to my mountain bike. Since I have never ridden a road bike it I can not compare it to anything except my mountain bike. In the speed respect it blows it away and that is what I was after. This bike, like any bike needs TLC. You can't just pound and pound it every single day and not expect it to wear. Sure some stuff wears faster... but if you are a true and smart cyclist then you don't have a problem with giving any of your rides the attention they deserve. Granted, the less time you spend on the work bench the better. Such is life.

Strength:
Cost!Very comfortable bike.Recommended for day touring.Fast bike.Good all around speed and stout enough to put a rack on.


Weakness:
Shifters/Deraileurs not suited for racing or heavy use.Small crank almost useless.


2006 BikeI bought this bike as a inexpensive get back into cycling bike. Back in the 90's I rode a trek 5200. I didn't want to spend alot on a high end bike if I wasn't going to utilize it. I am very happy with my purchase. I primarily use to for day rides or to cruise 10-20 and stop for breakfast,lunch etc. I have the 56cm and am 5'8.5"". I could probably have done fine with the 54cm, but have a large frame and the larger size is more comfortable. I don't plan on using this bike for racing and I probably wouldn't recommend it. The 1200 or 1500 Treks would be better with their upgraded components. The frame is fine, but any extra spend on the componentry would be worth the extra dough. I haven't had any failures with the shifting; it's just noisy at times and isn't fluid. I haven't any problems with the tires so far and I prefer them to what I rode when I had the Trek 5200. 25C vs. 20C on the 5200. I was always getting flats with those things. Obviously the Trek 1000 is not as nimble or efficient as even an old Trek 5200, but who cares I'm old and am not joining the USCF anymore.

Strength:

Weakness:
wheels, and the tiagra components. But for a bike under 600 they work great.


This bike is nice for what I wanted it to do. I ride to and from work up many hills and this bike does well. The handle bar tape has started to fall off at about 75 miles but other than that everything is still working. This bike is smooth and is a pleasure to ride. I did change out the tire for a higher P.S.I. though. The tires that are on it are really soft and I cant afford a flat on the way to work. The upper derailer works but you have to force it hard to get it up on the higher gear.

I have mine for about 2 months now and i have driven around 800 km on it and so far i have had 1 flat tire and thats all it does require some attention and good oiling on the Shimano sora and Tiagra systems because i know from my personal experience that after a while the derailer will have difficulty,s with reaching the higher gears I clean it after every ride and i can just watch it and see how its all nice and shiny in the sun :D i race a lot on itand on the highest gear i took it out on a sprint on a straight long road and reached a top speed of 59 km/phso it certainly is fast. This is without a doubt the best bike i have ever bought!!

Strength:
Entry level price; beautiful paint job on both men and women's bikes; choice of handle bar heights; reliable shifting and handling for my purposes.


Weakness:
Components seem kinda flimsy, bend easily and are sometimes noisy. No major problems so far.


I have the 2006 WSD version of the Trek 1000. I am brand new to road biking-my previous bikes have all been comfort bikes. I am sure this review will reflect my basic entry level riding skills!  At age 47, I did not know if I wanted to spend a lot of money on a style of bike that I feared I might not like, so I checked out various entry-level bikes. My main interest was developing fitness and maybe eventually doing charity rides.  The Trek 1000 got a good review from Bicycling Magazine and seemed to be well rated on this site. My local bike shop also had my size even this late in the season (47 cm). So far, I am in love with this bike and road cycling in general!! I don't know how I have lived this long without having one. This bike is light compared to my 30 lb. comfort bike and runs remarkably smooth and fast. It seems to shift reliably enough for me-but I have not tried any hard hills yet. The bike shop gave a choice of three different handlebar heights; I choose the middle height but wish I had gone with the comfort height because of hand numbness. I think this is me and not the bike, however, but the choice is there if you need it. I am a heavier rider and so far have not had any problems with breaking spokes or wheels, but I stay on the bike path for now and don't do curb hopping etc.  The seat so far has been comfortable; my rides are between 12 and 20 miles at a time. The components seem kinda flimsy, but I have not had any major problems with them. This bike has been a breath of fresh air--I cannot wait to ride it. Trek did a good job of creating a decent entry level road bike to draw me in and get me hooked on riding!!

Weakness:
Carbon seatpost cracked soon after getting it. Low PSI tires stock. Sora Shifters


Review for 2006 model. I bought this bike because I was interested in doing triathlon but also wanted to have a bike for charity and social rides. Didn't want to break the bank on a high-end bike and have it gather dust in the garage. For the money this bike has performed very well and met all my expectations. Some of the components could be better quality but for an entry level bike I'm happy with them. Sora shifters are not great but they have done the job well. A little hefty but again for $700 or less it's a great bike.

Excellent entry level bike. If you're planning on getting into the sport, I would suggest this bike. Also a great ride if you're worried about your race bike being stolen. Rides pretty smooth. It could use some better tires. Wheels are not good at all. Stock pedals must go. You can punch out as many miles as you need on this bike w/out worrying about breaking it. Great starter choice again. Good bike to toss on the trainer for the winter.

Weakness:
Sora drivetrain is pretty cheap but it works. Blew both tubes and rear tire after 100 miles. Needed to have the bar rewrapped after the first ride. Brakes are weak, but again, they work


Bought this bike to give my mountain bike a break from commuting duty. What a difference. I hadn't been on a road bike in 20 years and I can't believe I waited so long. For an entry level bike, I've been very impressed. I thought it was a little rough at first, but that was just my body adapting to the lack of a suspension fork. Now that I've gotten used to it, it feels a lot smoother and so fast. The shifters are not the best and require occasional adjusting, but after a while the extra push to get the chain up onto the next chainring becomes second nature. For the price, you really can't ask for more. This is definitely an entry level bike, no doubt about that, but it puts to shame any X-mart bike.

I like this bike a lot. I purchased it to have a less expensive bike that I wouldn't worry about. This bike has become my favorite. I ride it more often than my Trek 5500 and I ride it everywhere, work, store, group rides, school. Yes it is heavier and not as stiff as the OCLV but something about it keeps me riding it.It's a versatile bike as I often put a rear rack on it for commuting and carrying stuff home from the store. I can take off the rack and go do some group rides.The sora stuff, though only 8 speed, shifts great. It has to be adjusted from time to time but so do dura-ace derailleurs.

Strength:
I don't know why people are complaining about the frame. I've taken my share of spills and even got hit by a car, and the only thing that's gotten bent was my front rim.  As a short women, this is one of the few entry level road bikes that comes in small enough sizes.. so kudos to trek. 


Weakness:
The front derailleur is a bit cranky (as mentioned ad naseum by other reviewers). But I've found if my bike shop aligns it every couple of months (gratis) it doesn't really create a problem.This isn't a bike for a fast rider. It feels very squirrelly and unstable at higher speeds. (>35 ish?)


As an entry level and commuting bike, this was a great buy! It fit my budget and skills. I only ride about 60-80 miles or so a week and the outdoor season in WI is relatively short. So its hard to justify a more expensive bike. I've had my bike for 2 years, and while I would love to upgrade, I own a perfectly servicable road bike. Its aluminum, and mine is carbonless, so the vibration isn't all that fantastic.

I've had this bike for a year now and overall I have to say it's been a great entry level bike. Basically, this was my introduction to road cycling. I had a few problems with the shifting at first (it wouldn't even go into the big ring when I first got it, then it struggled to get into it)but after the attention of a good bike mechanic the shifting is now pretty smooth. I've never had any problems with the brakes. The ride is somewhat bone-jarring, especially on descents. It's a fun bike--not the fastest, but so what? Basically, it got me into cycling and now that I know I like cycling I can obsess over getting a faster, smoother ride. But for the money, it was so worth it.

Strength:
Good price, good paint, comes with carbon fiber seatpost/fork (although bottom of line Bontrager parts). Trek has a good warranty/crash replacement program.


Weakness:
Harsh ride, bottom of line carbon fiber does barely anything. Would take a mid-price aluminum or steel fork over the carbon. Too heavy for a harsh ride.


[actually a 2006 model year]Great value! You get what you paid for. Honestly got it just because of the color and I had money to spend. Not race worthy and not the best ride in terms of comfort. I liken it to an old Doge Neon thats been well-maintained with an awesome paint job. Tiagra RD will let you upgrade to a 9-speed from 8-speed cassette, but might as well go to 105 or Ultegra then. It's pretty heavy (23lbs, I think) for the ride, steel bikes nowadays are a little lighter and a heck of a better ride. I am planning to upgrade stuff onto the frame. Frame is decent and I am pretty sure that Trek usues same frame (geometry, thickness, etc) for all their Alpha Aluminum SL roadies. Project 1 too expensive just for the paint, better deal with buy and upgrade yourself.

Strength:
Price.


Weakness:
weight, flex, component quality.


I never understand why people review entry-level products and complain that the quality isn't as good as high-end stuff. The bottom line with the Trek 1000 is that it can get you out on the road for less than $600. That fit my situation perfectly when I bought mine in the summer of '05. I wanted to start riding, but didn't want to/couldn't afford to spend a bunch of money on a bike and find out that I wasn't going to enjoy the sport as much as I'd hoped. From late July to about mid-September, I put about 1000 miles on my orange/white 1000. Yes, the Sora shifters are clunky, the Bontrager crank is lame and the bike is heavy and flexy. But it cost about $500! 

Once I realized that I LOVE road cycling, I started upgrading the bike. The first thing I changed was the crank. I got an Ultegra on Ebay for a good price. Of course, I also put on Shimano pedals. I just ordered FSA Wing Pro bars, an FSA stem and Shimano 105 shifters. I'm already looking around for wheelsets to replace the heavy Alex units that came with the bike. Within another month, I'll have a lot more money in components than what I spent on the bike, but that's ok. The frame is decent and at worst, I can move parts to another frame in the future or keep this as a winter/wife bike. 

One thing I noticed recently, while riding on my trainer is how much side-to-side movement there is in the bottom bracket. Yikes! I guess that's what you get with the cheaper aluminum frames. 

The bottom line, though, is that this bike got me on the road and was good enough to get me totally hooked.

Strength:
Quick like a bunny. Looks good. Would be good for someone as a recreational bike and not wanting to pony up a lot of loot.


Weakness:
Aluminum front fork, which has since been replaced with carbon. Weak spokes. Terrible generic alloy brakes.


This is for the 2003 version, 60cm frame. I bought this bike because I started doing long road tours and my Trek 4300 wasn't cutting it. It's a good-looking bike with a quality frame, but has a few flaws.

First and foremost, this is a pre-carbon fork model so it will vibrate the life right out of your hands.

Second are the cheap alloy brakes that come stock. It frightens me to see how they flex and the pads leave gunk all over your rims.

Third are the spokes. Others have commented on how easy it is to break a rear spoke. I popped one and relaced both wheels with DT Swiss double-butted spokes on Shimano hubs.

The bike does have it's good points. The frame is outstanding and the bike accellerates like a scared jackrabbit. I never had any troubles with the drive, but those little plastic nubs on the levers for downshifting always bugged me. I considered simply upgrading the fork, since that was my biggest complaint, and the brakes, but then I saw the '05 Trek 1500 and ditched the 1000. Haven't regretted it since.

Strength:
Good Frame pretty light, shifting is fine if you have a good mechanic.


Weakness:
Rims, Terrible Rims. Shifting can be bad if you have a bad mechanic.


I bought this bike in may of 05 and have put 1300 miles on it. Its not a bad bike for the price. I think the frame is good and the shifting is good now that I've had a good mechanic working on it. I replaced the seat with a Gel Seat and replaced the tires. The stock wheels blow. They get out of true after the first ride back from the bike store. Happened 4 times. I basically need to buy a new wheel set and that will cost 300 or more. I've decided instead to buy a second bike. A Tarmac Comp 06. I may take the Tarmac Comps wheels and put them on the Trek and buy a better set to put on the Tarmac eventually.
I had no idea I was planning to ride this much, but if you do plan to ride alot. Be prepared to spend lots of cash.

Strength:
Price and a very good handleing ride.


Weakness:
Front derailer.


Originaly I bought the bike for training purposes because I'm a moutain bike racer in the sport level. All I neede was an entry level bike. Bicycling magazine rated this bike the #1 choice for an under $1000.00 road bike. 

The paint on this bike looks great and is eye catching. I waited a month for the orange color when I ordered it but it was worth the wait. I don't know why some of the previous reviews knock the welds, the welds on my bike are excellent. The bike handles like a dream and is a fast entry level road bike. I climb most of the hills around here using only the 2nd chain ring on the crank. I can't remember ever using the low chain ring. The Alex 450 wheels are heavy so acceration suffers. The carbon forks smooth out the ride. Past reviews have knocked the stock brakes but I have no problem stopping with them from my 45-50 MPH down hill runs. The only issue I have had with the bike is the shimano 2203 front derailer. You have to have it in the correct rear gear or the chain will either jump off the side of the crank chain ring or it won't shift from the 2nd to the large chain ring at all. One has to remember this is an entry level bike with Sora shifters so shifting will not be as smooth as the shimano 105 and up. Since I gotten for involved with road riding, I decided to up grade the bike to all shimano 105 componets and changed the triple crank for double crank. It is amazing the differance that has made in shifting. It is smooth now and no longer a problem in shifting the crank chain rings. I have replaced the heavy Alex wheels with Bontranger race wheels. They have smooth out the ride and increased my speed because of the bladed spokes. All the changes have made dropped the weight of the bike to just a little over 19 pounds. I could drop it even more by replacing my moutain bike pedals with lighter road petals.

I had to knock off 1 point for the shifting on the front chain ring.
Buy the bike if you want an excellant handling entry level road bike.

Strength:
Price. It does have a carbon fiber fork and seat post. The Sora components are not bad for entry level.


Weakness:
This is a bike an average rider would outgrow in a year. It is not a bike that is going to last you 4 or 5 years. The frame welds are very sloppy. If you are looking at an entry level, why not try the 1500. A little more money but it will last you so much longer. 
This is not a bad value, however you will outgrow it with a little time.


This is Trek's entry level bike. Let reiterate that: IT IS TREK'S ENTRY LEVEL BIKE. You are not going to go on the tour with this bike. It is for the person who occasionally rides. Not the person who does centuries every weekend. I would not recommend this bike to someone getting into the sport who thinks they will do a lot of riding.

Strength:
Smooth comfortable ride. Rear derailleur is pretty smooth.


Weakness:
Front derailleur is highly inferior.


I was originally very pleased with this bike (see earlier review) but have since become more and more displeased with the performance of the front derailleur. This bike comes stock with a Shimano 2203 FD. Unless you're going out for very flat rides that don't require you to do much shifting upfront, the quality of your rides will be significantly diminished by the suspect performance of this component. Basically, when you crest a hill (and have gotten down to the lower end of your rear cogs) the front derailleur will not lift the chain up on to the big gear up front unless you cycle back up through your rear set first. This is very frustrating. This bike is listed on Trekbikes.com as a ""Performance"" road bike. I don't call this performance. I was told by a dealer that the '06 has a Shimano 105 upfront. If I had it to do over again, I would have gone with that bike or saved up some more cabbage and gone with a higher end bike.

Great bike for the $. LBS made modifications for me @ no extra charge (see below). A little heavy for a road bike @ 22lbs, but far lighter than the Trek 7300FX I was riding. I know folks have complained about the components, but the Tiagra RD combined with the Sora FD and Alivio shifters work flawlessly. The frame is wonderful. The catbon fork & carbon seat post smooth out the bumps. The brakes are the bike's weakest point, but I replaced the pads with Kool-Stop Dura-type pads (a $15 upgrade) and the difference is night and day. For $479 you simply cannot do better!

Strength:
Lots of zip, comfortable. Fairly light. Feels sturdy. Great price!


Weakness:
Floppy straps make getting into the pedals downright hazardous. Brakes are a bit weak.


I just got this bike yesterday and took it out for a short spin. This is my first true road bike (other bike is a hybrid) and I was very pleased with the feel of the bike. To me, it's very comfortable quick and climbs very nicely. I took it out exploring some nearby subdivisions and was actually excited when I came to the bottom of a long, STEEP hill and found a cul de sac! My other bike only has two chain rings up front so it was good to be able to have the extra gear to work through. The shifting is better than I expected. It does take some getting used to and you need to work within the limits of the equipment. If you don't put too much stress on the cables and derailleurs (e.g. work down through the rear cogs rather than dropping down up front when approaching a steep incline) than the shifting is much smoother. I will however have to put clipless pedals on it ASAP. The clips and straps are a major pain. Also, I'm a pretty big guy so I would also prefer more braking power. But, I think I'm really going to enjoy this bike. I'll add more as I ride more.

I recieved this bike second hand. A very good bike for the price but has flaws. The Sora brake levers and a pain. The brakes are poor (Sora) and not the lightest bike in the world. But for anyone with £500 wanting to give road racing a go the trek 1000 is the way forwards. The Alex Rims that came with the bike are suspect, kept losing spokes but bought some bontrager selects and they are excellent. The seat is not too bad either, i think but im not sure that the new model trek 1000 has carbon seatstay.

Weakness:
Front Derailer or Front shifters. Huge Problems from the first time I got the bike.


The Bike is nice, except the front Derailer or front Shifter is Total Junk. I've been to the bike shop 4 times already to adjust the front Derailer and today will be the 5th time. I have no confidence the front derailer will be fixed, cause it seems to be made of cheap thin metal. I just got the bike about 2 weeks ago and from the first time I rode it the front Derailer caused me problems. What a joke of a bike. Last week, I couldnt shift to the largest ring. Now, it completly skips the middle ring in the front sets going down and when shifting back up hardly ever hits the middle ring. Also the seat is hard as a rock!

Mainly a review about the store. First off if you are ordering the bike in late April as I did, I had to wait for a month. I was told 7 to 14 days for the bike, but I ended up waiting a month, and when the bike finally arrived, they told me it would be built and ready on a certian day but it wasnt. It should be ready tomorrow. Overall, I think they are swamped cause its the busiest time of the year and I'll give them a slight pass on service. The store I got it from Silver City had easily the best prices around by far. From $60 to $100 dollar savings on the Trek 1000 so and it was worth the wait for me. Not only was the bike the cheapest, the helmet Trek Vapor 3 cost me 35 bucks. Everywhere else it was 40 or 50 bucks.(Dealors within 50 miles of my area code) I'll give a review of the bike when I start riding it. It's my first road bike.

Perfect first road bike. I was ready to be disapointed because I had been looking at road bikes in the 1k-2k range. (I have several friends who are hard core roadies-mega peer pressure.) It would be a shame to have that kind of money hanging on my garage wall if I didn't take to it. I am VERY pleased, and surprised at the quality. This is a fine bike at a fantastic price. Bike is tight, great ergos for a nube, and pretty fast. A fantastic ballance of quality and price. I don't think I will ever sell it. I will upgrade the group in the future. I live in an extremely hilly town (Fountian Hills, AZ) and the gear ratios work well for me. The lowest might be too low for less hilly environs, but the 'granny' gear is a blessing for me. I can always swap it out cheap.

Strength:
Reasonable price compared with other road bikes.

Solid Frame.

Decent quality seat and wheels.

Reliability. (Have ridden 2,000 miles with only minor problems)


Weakness:
Shifting is somewhat weak with Sora components (even after bike shop has done numerous drivetrain adjustments).

Trek 1000 feels tinny and cheap compared with the Giant OCR2, which was purchased for only $200 more.

Not a good bike for serious riders who intend to race.

Pedals installed on the bike were the cheap, old-school shoe-in-strap type (bought clipless pedals and shoes and have been happier since)


This bike is a good, solid, entry-level road bike. Having said that, I would only recommend this bike to someone who intends to take recreational rides and doesn't want to spend a ton of money. I quickly decided after purchasing this bike that I enjoyed riding enough that I want to train seriously and race, and this is NOT the bike to do that with. It just isn't equipped to do so. The rear cassette is only an eight-speed and the triple front cogs are a waste of time. The smallest front cog is useless unless you like to ride under 10 mph or up EXTREMELY steep hills. All in all, though, I have been happy with the mechanical reliability of the bike. I've ridden it almost 2,000 miles in a year and have only had to have minor adjustments to the drivetrain. The Shimano Sora components are a bit cheesy and cheap and don't shift nearly as smoothly as my Giant OCR2 which is equipped with Shimano 105 components. Shifting can be finicky on the Trek 1000, which is my main complaint with the bike. Other than that, for the price it is a very good bike for someone who wishes to try out road cycling without spending thousands of dollars.

For 2005 trek upgraded to a carbon fork, tiagra rd and the frame is now the alpha SL. This is a nice bike for the money. It is perfect for someone to get started cycling. You dont have to spend thousands of $ to have fun and get in shape. The sora shifters are not as smooth as Ultegras or Dura-ace but they work fine. I am very happy with the Trek 1000, great bike for the money.

Good entry level bike, but if you are like me and ride almost everyday now and take training somewhat serious, you will notice it's not the going to meet your needs. The tiagra group doesnt shift smoothly and gives me problems, the fork is to soft, frame is heavy, and lots of BB flex (i'm 180ish lbs). If you are a heavy strong rider I would not go with this bike. But if you are not sure if you will stick with cycling then spending 600 bucks is a good way to find out, and if you like cycling then expect to want a new bike to meet more demanding needs.

Weakness:
Sora components, seat, brakes are terrible (buy a new set of Ultegra brake pads), wheels are cheap. The bike is less than $600 so you can't expect the best parts!


Great entry level road bike! I was looking at the Trek 1000 and a Specialized at the same price but decided on the Trek because of fit. I have long legs and a short upper body so the Trek is more comfortable. The bike is only a couple of weeks old so I can't say how the components hold up but overall for the price it's a pretty solid bike. Trek addressed the shifting issue by upgrading the rear derailer to a Tiagra unit. This year they also upgraded to a carbon fork and carbon seat post. The stock seat is too soft and it flexes so much it's uncomfortable (I'm just under 200 pounds, so for a lighter rider it may be fine). I'll update this after a couple months and a few hundred miles to say how the component group and wheelset holds up.

Strength:
Cheap and strong. Great commuting and light training bike


Weakness:
None for the price - could pick some out but not at £500


I bought my Trek to get back into cycling after a long long break. Didn't want to spend too much at first and saw the Trek as an ideal starting point.

Since then I almost sold it to fund a better bike but in the end kept both, the Tifosi for club runs in the summer and the Trek for a winter bike and year round commuting.

I haven't had any problems with the Sora groupset (except the crappy brakes but hey) and I've ridden the bike weeks on end wihtout any cleaning or oiling through our lovely English winters. Never needed adjusting, never not changed precisely.

Done a couple of centuries and its been fine.

OK not the best bike in the world and not the lightest but hey its £500. All in al for the daily thrashing across town its great.

Strength:
price is decent, overall frame quality is good, good support from many dealers, the Lance factor does not hurt either, looks good, stiff and responsive, handles well.


Weakness:
poor brakes, Sora is not much of a group, saddle poor, wheel/spokes poor, chain drops off too often, installed chain-stopper device to cure this one for good.


A good entry level road bike, too uncomfortable (virbations) on rough roads, terrible brakes (Sora?) and terrible brake pads. I replaced them with DuraAce brake pads which improved things but still brakes are very poor. Also I am only 148-150 lbs rider, not big, 5 foot 8 inches, not tall, and after 2000 miles I broke my rear wheel spoke. I do not hop any kerbs or ride potholes, so wheel/spoke quality is poor. Saddle is also poor. I replaced it with Selle Italia Flite GelFlow for instant vast improvement. I expect carbon forks in 2005 model may have improved the ride quality but Trek need to dump Sora for good and look at the wheel/spoke quality.
Also, chain drops off too often, had to install chain-stopper device to fix it for good. Not sure if Sora is to blame here. Beats me why Trek still puts Sora group on road bikes in this price range. Travelled ~2000 miles in a year since new.

Weakness:
you get what you pay for, wheels kinda bunk, sora is, well, sora.


ok, so heres the breakdown. i bought this bike as an entry level road bike, probably what most people would buy it for. for the price, i think it has a lot of stregnths and also some weaknesses. the frame is fine, not too stiff despite what some might say about aluminum. sora drivetrain is reasonable, not great, but by no means a sin against biking. i got a new (smaller) cassette and took some links out of the chain and i noticed a marked improvemnet. by trek's own admission the sora rear der is only supposed to handle a 25 tooth cog but the largest on the SRAM cassette is 26. i keep my bike very clean and do a lot of maintenace and the shifting is fine. however, it seems like if you let the sora system go in terms of cleanliness/adjustment it might be terrible. moving on, my only big complaint was the wheels. i (185 lbs), like many other bigger riders was breaking spokes left and right (rear wheel drive side), which was a pain. the LBS respoked that side under warranty which ws cool, but they shouldnt have had to, not a bike with 250 miles on it. but 1000 miles later ive given in and bought an old set of opens pros with ultegra and dura ace. i rebuilt them and its like a different bike. the hubs on the alex wheels are kinda crappy, but if you know overhauls then you should be able to redo them. just last week my right pedal started making annoying noises, but that ok because i have some looks on the way. but, thats 1000 miles from a big guy on some plastic pedals. not too shabby i guess, but they had to cut corners somewhere to offer the bike at this price.

I've been a mountainbiker and wanted to try road. This bike seemed entry level. I've now ridden it for well over 2000km and am very pleased with it. It seems to be able to keep up with much higher spec bikes. 

I do a lot of hill climbing and this bike seems quite capable. The Sora componentry works well so long as you keep it clean and serviced. I've had no breakdowns yet. The bike feels good and I like the colour too!

Pedal and saddle change have made a great improvement to this bike and I wish I'd bought them earlier. The rough ride on coarse chip means carbon fork / seat post will be my next upgrades. The brakes are just satisfactory and have led to some nail biting descents. 

Overall a fantastic entry level bike for the price. Potential for upgrading components.

Strength:
Good value (fairly light + cheap).
Dependable (no failures).
Short top-tube great for people with short torsoes (i.e. many women).
Heavy wheels beneficial in training if replaced with race wheels for competition.


Weakness:
Heavy wheels.
Cheap components + tripple = shifting leaves something to be desired.
Could be lighter and more aero (but not really at this price).


This is my wife's bike. She's a triathlete. We got this bike because she had tried a triathlon (on a mountainbike with slicks) and decided she wanted to do more. We were very price conscious, but were finding most bikes of decent weight to be $1200+...then we came across this bike. It was easily the lightest bike we ran into under $800-1000, plus it fit her perfectly (Treks seem to have short top tubes, which are great for people like her with short torsoes). We found it for a good price, and haven't looked back since. 

My wife is now a much better triathlete, actually sponsored this season. We have this bike setup for her with some aero bars (used ones given to us by a friend), Speedplay X/2 petals, and borrowed a Zipp 404 wheelset for a couple races (and plan to purchase a set of these used - they rock). It actually makes for a pretty fast budget setup.

Had she not crashed at 27mph (and broken her shoulder, etc) in the Loveland Lake2Lake triathlon this year, she could have easily captured 1st in her age group or even placed in overall women. She ended up sitting on the side of the road for 15 or so minutes and then finished the race (despite injuries) and ended up 10th in her age group.

It very well may be time to get serious and get a lighter, more aero bike...but this frame seems to work pretty as a base well once you get some real petals and race wheels. The heavy wheels it comes with are still mostly true (after 3000 miles w/o being touched) and are actually probably beneficial to build strength during training. We obviously do light maintanance to keep wear down (cleaning, adjusting, replacing chain), but it is nice to note that nothing has failed or really given us any trouble...it even stayed perfect through a serious wreck.

The one real complaint is shifting, espcially up front...but that's what you get when you combine cheap components and a tripple.

Strength:
Great all-around bike for entry-level cyclists! This bike does it all pretty well for very little money.


Weakness:
If you know you're going to stick with the sport or even race, spend a little more. Otherwise, buy this bike!


I'm reviewing the 2002 Trek 1000. Aside from maybe the Specialized Allez, hands down the best value in entry-level. I bought this bike to do a triathlon without spending a lot. I've put over 3300 miles on it since and still going strong! 

I did have a few problems at first. I kept breaking spokes on the rear wheel, so my LBS rebuilt it. Also, the stock 12-28 cassette is too big for the Sora derailleur (even by Trek's own admission, the derailleur is only meant for a 27 tooth cog), causing shifting/drivetrain problems. Replaced by LBS w/ 12-25. Also, after about 2000 miles, bottom bracket had to be replaced. 1300 miles later, no complaints. 

This is my only road bike, so I ride it year round. It has held up very well to road grime, rain, salt, sweat & abuse from the indoor trainer, etc. Replaced tires twice, once with 20c (very fast, but not as comfy as 25c it came with), and again with 23c, probably the best size for my riding style.

Geometry is good, just get the right stem to avoid lower back pain. I'm 6'3"" 200lbs on a 63cm, fits me well. Handling and acceleration are okay, given its weight and component specs. Suppose you could get better, but you'd spend more $ and I doubt you'd notice the difference as a beginner anyway.

Comfortable and Fast. I actually use mine quite frequently for commutingand it holds up great. Shifting really is not as bad as some make it sound either. If your derailleurs are adjusted properly it will produce smooth shifting. The brakes ""could"" use a little more oomph.. however a new set of 12 dollar pads would solve that.


Weakness:
wheels. I couldn't seem to keep my rear in true. Got a replacement from the dealerand it appears to me that this one is going to hold up better though.

This bike is awesome. I got mine almost as soon as they came out back in August or September. Got the Pearl White Baja Blue colors and it looks awesome!! I have had no major problems. There is no bottom bracket flex. I can stand up and sprint my heart out with no complaint from the bike. The shifting can be poor at times but all it needs is a quick adjustment. This bike sprints like a cheetah and climbs equally well. The wheels are very good just watch out for a clicking sounds which is easily fixed with a little lube. (that sound is just the spokes rubbing...no biggie) Overall the bike has improve my average speed..cant imagine what a 5200 would do for my average speed. Definitely worth they money if your on a budget. For the price you pay its an awesome ride! Trek did a great job making an awesome entry level bike with an even better frame. Gave it 5 overall because its not trek's fault sora has problems

I purchased this bike about 3 weeks ago and I am very satisfied with it. I have since put about 300 miles on it, mostly on poorly paved country roads, and it has stood up to much abuse with very little maintenance - just a simple shifting adjustment and a tube replacement. The frame is stiff and responsive, with carbon in the right places to effectively smooth out road vibrations. I switched to this bike from a Trek 4500 hard tail, so my experience with road cycling is limited, but I highly recommend this bike.

Strength:
Smooth comfortable ride, Doesn't flex as much as the 5000 or 5200. Great price! Full Ultegra 10speed!!


Weakness:
SADDLE!!!! When will bontrager make a saddle that isn't and @ss hatchet! Be careful of the Race wheels if your a bit heavier. I've seen many come back to the shop with spokes pulling trough the rim - if this happens try to get the race lite rims and have the wheel re-laced, those rims have eyelets making it much stronger.


Over all this bike is a great ride for the money. The ZR9000 frame is light and responsive. The 2006 model is the last year that trek is using OCLV carbon in the rear stays. OCLV is lighter then TCT but TCT comes at a cheaper price. The deep apple red of this bike is very classy and not flashy. The decals are a bit much but I have grown to like them. I have never noticed any flex in the frame, ever! I am about 150lb so It's not that big a strain on the bike. I was surprized at how smooth this bike was, it was almost like being on my mt. bike with suspension on it. The Carbon eats every little bump the road gives you and the alum. keeps it nice, stiff, and responsive.  The Drive train is flawless. Not as fast as DuraAce but the ultergra 10 speed double groupo is world class

Strength:
Strengths. This is a poor man's Klein.The 2000 frame offers a good balance of responsive and smooth riding. The Stiff and light ZR9000 Aluminum (developed by Klein) delivers great power, yet ride remains smooth thanks to the carbon fork, seatstays, and seatpost. An excellent choice for aggressive riders who want speed and responsiveness but can tough out the slightly bumpier ride that an all carbon frame would prevent.


Weakness:
I might want to upgrade the saddle soon, but bottom line you get what you pay for so I don't have any significant weaknesses to talk about. It is a much nicer ride than the Trek 1500 but it is also more expensive. When compared to the next bike up (5000 or 5200) the difference is the shock absorbing qualities of a full carbon frame. Sure a full carbon is smoother but it is a bit less responsive. For the best of both worlds-stiffness and smoothness-you would have to get a Madone for alot more money.


This is a review for a 2006 Trek 2000 Road Bike. The Trek 2000 is the equivalent of the 2200 or 2300 on the US market, and is available only in certain countries (Japan in my case). The main difference is that the bike is assembled in Taiwan or in rare cases Germany, as opposed to the US. It also uses TCT Carbon as opposed to OCLV. In terms of craftsmanship, a Trek made in Taiwan or Germany is not necessarily of poorer quality then one made in the US. Nevertheless the US made have a higher prestige. The Carbon on the other hand is a bit different. TCT is equally shock absorbing and strong, but it is slightly heavier than the US made OCLV. The rest of the bike is more or less identical since it comes with full Ultegra 10spd, and mid to high end Bontrager saddle, seatpost, wheels, stem, and handlebars.Price of course is high when compared to the US, yet in your domestic market Trek is still the best value you can find.

This bike handles like a part of you. Just think of what you want to do and it performs for you. It accelerates very quick. No wasted energy. I can go on a 40 mile ride and it is very comfortable.

Strength:
Ride comfort
Smooth shifting
Responsivenss
Made in WI (got to support the home team)


Weakness:
Over the top decals. The bike has good paint but the garrish decals cheapen the look. Something more understated would be better.


I ride a Specialized Mtn. bike converted to streetfighter commuter that I ride to and from work (80 miles a week). But, I've always been a fan of road racing and this year I was really jazzed about the Tour and Lance possibly getting a sixth so I decided to take the plunge and get a road bike.
 The 2200 was in my price range. I also tested the 2100 and the 1500. The 2100's components were not that strong and the 1500's aluminum frame was too stiff for comfort.
 Comfort. That was my biggest fear about getting a road bike. The 2200 has a surprisingly soft ride. Three plus hours in the saddle is not a hardship. Soft but not mushy. When you put the spurs to this bike it moves. It feels like your entire pedal effort is translated into forward motion, not frame flex.
 I had read reviews critical of the saddle but because I am light, (155), and the carbon damping of the ride, I have not found it to be a problem.
 The bike shifts very smoothly. The only indication the rear derailleur gives you when you shift is a change in pedal effort, no noise. 
 Maybe because of what I am used to riding, the best thing I can say about it is, the bike is not something I think about when I am riding. It doesn't hurt me, when I pedal I move, on descents it is smooth. It's like the bike isn't there. Ascending hills have actually become my favorite part of a ride.

Weakness:
Decals - okay at first, but overall it's too flashy for my taste


My overall impression of this bike in the past 90 days since I purchased it has been positive. I have had no significant problems with the bike and feel it has meet all my expectations.

This is my first decent road bike, as I am just getting into the sport. When I purchased this bike it was between the Trek 1500 and 2200. I feel the 2200 is a signicantly better bike for the money (although it is quite a bit more). The frame with front/rear and seat post carbon provide an excellent ride.

My main use for this bike has turned into commuting, which should change once I acquire another bike for that purpose. In addition to my 8 mile commute, I ride about 50-150 miles a week.

The only problem I had so far was the bottom bracket making some creaking noises when I sprint out of the saddle.

Bought this bike brand new on eBay. What a great deal. Couldn't be happier. Handles great, super light, comfortable ride. Was worried about it being alum., boy was I wrong. Not even an issue. I compared this with a Lemond Zurich, and the ride was smoother on the 2200. I test rode bikes for 2 months and I'm very comfortable with this purchase. If you have the bucks, go for the 2300. If you want to save a little, get the 2200. The ride is EXACTLY the same.

The 60cm size fit me well, the SL Groupo was what I was looking for and the technological changes appealed to the tack geek in me. The bike has performed well on sprint fests, long multi day tours and social rides. The biggest gains to me were zero BB movement and a solid backend without feeling like a brick. Overall it is a huge improvement over my old Reynolds 853 Dean.

Strength:
EVERTHING! Actually everything except the wheels.


Weakness:
The bundled wheelset.


After much handwringing and riding many, many bikes, I finally settled on the 2008 Madone 5.2. I could not be happier and LOVE this bike. I was skeptical of some of the marketing but am not after having some quality saddle time on the Madone.  The ride is very comfortable even over harsh roads yet the frame is so very stiff and translates everything into power. It really does everything exceptionally: handling, climbs, sprints, long-distance, races... if you can own only one road bike for everything this is your huckleberry. I can't wipe the smile off of my face when I ride this bike. If you don't like the Madone 5.2 then cycling isn't the right hobby for you. I bought the Pro fit after trying both Pro and Performance fits extensively. I'd highly recommend giving the Pro fit a try, I thought this would be too oriented for racers only but the shop encouraged me to try it and I love this fit. I swapped the Shimano for SRAM Rival (personal preference, the Shimano stuff is great too).  Didn't like the wheels at all, they had a flimsy feel to them that I easily noticed (have heard many horror stories too on these). I upgraded to the Mavic Kysrium SL's which are amazing... light, stiff, and bullet-proof. The change in the ride is noticeable. I thought I was going to change the VR bars for Ergo but actually really like them.  Got rid of the seat and white bar tape (only black for me).  I'm totally old school in how I like a bike to look and wasn't sure I could ever love the new school look of the Madone or other bikes currently on the market. I've really warmed up the the mod styling of the Madone, it is a great looking bike.

I do like the ride.


Weakness:
Bottom bracket service and install procedures are not in agreement with marketing and published information.


My frames bottom bracket cup on the drive side was out of spec and required a bearing press which doesn't jive with Treks marketing and assembly instructions.The replacement frame was even worse with both cups out of spec. Now the feedback I am getting is press fit is ok from Trek and it doesn't really matter if one side is a slip fit and the other requires a press/puller to service.  I do not see how frames this far out of spec make it out the door at the factory and make you wonder what else about the quality of the frame is simply ""close enough""

I purchased this bike last summer. I wanted to have some good mileage on the bike before I wrote a review. So, the bike is a dream. This is such a upgrade from my 2005 Cannondale Six13. The bike has been such a pleasure to ride. I've put over 1700 miles outdoor and countless hours indoor over the winter. The only thing that I changed on the bike is the bar tape and added my Fizik Arione seat to the bike. The new technology that Trek has incorporated into this bike is amazing.

Strength:
You can ride all day and not feel tired. It really is that comfortable. Great climber and descender too. Lovely design and good all rounder. Fantastic quality and finish.


Weakness:
Seat cap cracked after 100 miles. Replaced with new design cap under warranty. Sometimes my water bottle hits the bottom of the sloping top tube when I pull it out of the cage.


I bought the Madone 5.2 pro frameset (54cm) and had my local bike shop – Trisports in Letchworth build it into a complete bike. I’ve put 400 miles on this bike so far and everything people say about it is true. Very light (15lbs), very comfortable, smooth and quiet. Haven’t noticed the increased stiffness over my old 5200. (I only weigh 130lbs at 5’9”, so maybe why).Is it worth the price? Yes. If you want the best, it costs. You won’t be disappointed. Is it a worthy upgrade on a 5200/5900? In a word. No. Don’t get me wrong this is a fantastic bike, but maybe a bit to comfy/smooth. It seems to lack the feel that made the old models special. I can’t help thinking that I may have been just as happy (and less guilty) if I’d have upgraded the older bike. As the saying goes: “You pays your money...you take your choice”.

I got a test ride of the new 2008 trek 5.2 today and went on a 60 mile run with ups downs flats and bumps, this bike handles the lot superbly, not just great but superbly , the acceleration is instant with absolutley no loss of power, when i reached the climbs it was awsome the bike just surges forward with every revolution, it made a decent climber better,the bike also seems to float gracefully over the bumpy roads absorbing nearley all of the shocks, in fact i was purposley picking out the bumpiest parts just to see how good it was, it was excellent,so onto the decent 45 miles / hour no wobbles , stable as can be , into the bends at the bottom ,i normally slow down for them but thought i'd push this bike to it's limit ,it took the bends with a tiny amount of oversteer but i think if i was on my old trek at this speed i would possibly have came off, so there we have it .If your going to buy a bike in the future this bike need serious consideration as i'd say this is the best bike i have ever ridden , all the power is utilised and a great ride, if i could afford one i'd have one in an instant.

Weakness:
none so far. the bike is limited only by the capability of the one riding it


If you have money enough for only one road bike, then the Trek Madone 5.2 is all the bike you'll ever need. Ride it in the races or on a long epic ride till your butt gets sore as heck, the bike will not disappoint. Mediocre weekend racers like myself become better simply because the bike lets me ride like I've never rode before. I know Lance said ""its not about the bike"", but this time, I have to say in reply ""the Madone 5.2 made a faster rider out of me"". I just did a 2 day race (TTT and Crit) a weekend ago and all the time the bike seemed to talk to me, taunting me as if saying ""is that all you've got?!"", so I had to give more and ride better, faster, stronger. The other teams noticed my new aggressive riding style, and they commented positively too. Even sitting still the bike seems to be moving fluidly. I don't even have the highest model or the lightest components and yet the bike ended up having a weight of 15lbs +/- on a non-digital scale, including pedals and bottle cages. Truly, a triumph of design and functionality. The all new Madone frame is indeed a homerun from Trek. Again. Now I can't wait to take delivery of a new Fuel EX8 that I just ordered.

This is a review of the new 2008 Madone 5.2. I demoed it at the Pedro's Mtn Bike festival. The bike was part of the Trek demo fleet, expertly maintained by Trek factory mechanics, so everything worked perfectly. I rode it for 20 miles, on smooth state roads. Parts spec is indentical to my own bike, an 853 steel LeMond, making the comparison that much more useful. In short, I was very impressed with this bike. It is both very fast and very comfortable. It rides as smoothly as my LeMond, yet sprints even faster than my old Cannondale. I found that when sprinting, I'd keep accelerating, to a greater speed than I do on the LeMond, despite being tired from a long weekend of riding. I could feel no energy going to waste. The bike is also very predictable on fast descents, with no flex-induced wandering. I'd never been a big fan of Trek, considering them the ""the Chevrolet of bike companies"", but this bike is forcing me to rethink that. If Trek is Chevrolet, the '08 Madone is the Corvette. All the Tour de France involvement seems to have paid off. If you're looking for the latest and greatest in road bikes, you should consider it.

Strength:
As noted in review


Weakness:
None so far


When the new Madone was introduced, I was impressed with the pictures and the new technologies sounded interesting. However, I was riding a 5500, all Dura-Ace which had made me very happy for 3 years. When I took the 5500 in for a minor repair, I obviously looked around while waiting. There it was. A 5.2 Pro Build in my size. It was ready for a test ride, complete with Shimano pedals. Got my shoes on, took a pretty long ride, and was immediately blown away. SO, long story short, I bought it – and put the new set of Aeolus 5.0 wheels I had recently bought for the 5500 on it. Also changed out the stock bar for the new Bongrager blade. Since then, every ride just keeps getting better as I get dialed in. More speed, more acceleration, more comfort – what else is there? A 6.9 you say? They didn’t have a 6.9 of course, but I have put in lots of miles on a 2007 5.9SL, (Not mine, my son’s) and I would never have traded my 5500 for his. So other than spending another $4000.00, I really doubt that the 6.9 is that much better. In fact, I think it may be just a tad better IF the rider has the engine to take advantage of the few grams. Most of us do not. The deal-maker is the new Ultegra SL group. The weight gap with Dura-Ace is now nominal; and I see no difference in performance.

Strength:
Stiffness of Bottom bracket - ride it to experienc itFinish - smooth and ripple-freeWeightDescending


Weakness:
Compact crankset in Performance fit - but my dealer upgraded to 53/39Saddle - personal choicePrice


I have a 2005 Trek 5200 and the Trek sizing fits me well. Very happy with the 5200. A guy at the club got the new 5.2 madone and let me ride it immediately after a race - I was amazed at the difference, the 2008 Madone 5.2 is supposedly way stiffer, and you can feel it, standing up and stomping and you can feel the stiffness, it is beautiful and comfortable to ride. Descends nicely too, easier than my 5200 (of which i have no complaints) I compared it to the Scott Addict R4 - also beautiful to ride, but more like the 5200, the Madone was stiffer than both and noticeably different to ride. This is a great bike. I'd suggest you test ride other bikes with similar components to get the feel - in my experience it was heads an shoulders above the competition.

Strength:
Everything! The amount of time, energy and technology Trek put into this bike is going to be worth every penny spent by the consumer.


Weakness:
Can't think of any. Even the Bontrager seat was awesome (could be due to the seatmast technology, but it is MORE comfortable than my current Selle Italia Gel Flow saddle on an Alpha Q carbon seat post).


Just Demo'd the new 2008 Madone 5.2 today. Rode a 58cm Black Performance Fit Carbon frame, decked out with the new Ultegra SL group with a compact crank. This is one Heck of a Bike! Trek did an incredible job with the development of this machine. The acceleration is instantaneous (climbing or on a flat), the comfort in the saddle is 100% better than my current ride and it felt like the bike wasn't even under me, because it so light. Downhill it is very stable at speed. Turns quick without being jumpy. Frame is very stiff, but compliant (there is something to the seatmast technology). If you get a chance to try the new Madone, go for it! I know I found my next bike and am now ruined until I get one under my butt permanently!

Strength:
Climbs like a mountain goat.Really light and stiff.


Weakness:
Headshake at speeds over 50 mph.Saddle is worse than a 2x4.$1000 Lance tax


This is one of the better bikes on the market. There are many on the market, but my preference to only buy American made limits my choices although I will test ride anything. Having said that, when I was looking at new bikes it came down to the Cannondale Six13 and the Trek 5.9 SL Madone. Both bikes are awesome, climb like mountain goats, and have excellent transfer of power. Both had Dura Ace ten speed groups, so the only real difference was the frame and wheels. The Cannondale feels fast. When you step on the peddles, you feel an acceleration that you don't get with the Madone. The Madone is a smoother ride and it doesn't ""feel"" like you're going as fast. THIS IS JUST FEEL. I put both of these on the clock with the same power output. There is virtually no difference on level roads, but as soon as you hit some good hills, the Madone started to shine. I have a steep hill that takes 3 minutes and 5 seconds to climb on my Trek 5200. I shaved 25 seconds off this on the Cannondale and thought ""WOW, this is great."" Then I shaved 45 seconds off with the Trek. We have a winner. After all, glory is at the top of the mountain. Now for the bad part. Descents on the Madone are squirlly one you go over 52 mph. On one of my descents down Mitchell, the front end started to do a little dance. Nothing real bad and it did not get out of shape, but it made me feather the brakes a little to scrub speed. If your speeds are below 50 mph, don't worry about it. This is a great bike if you can get a good price. I am not a big fan of the Lance tax slapped on all Treks.

Strength:
OCLV 110 FrameCompact Drive crank-set great for spinningDura-ace ComponentsTeam paint job guaranteed to get looksLight weightClimbs as is you are sprinting on the flats. You can really feel the power transfer to the wheels.


Weakness:
NONE. When you buy a bike that retails for over 5K, you better love it!


2006 5.9SL is a Great Bike!Trek appears to have a love/hate relationship with cyclists. Some will say they make great bikes, others will say that the quality is average. The bottom line is Brand. Trek has a strong name, even if the company's success over the last 7 years can be attributed to Postal/Discovery. Never forget that when you produce as many OCLV frames as Trek, they better be good, or the consequences can be catostrophic! As for the ride, buy this bike! The frame dulls the vibration from rough road surfaces, the components are light and durable. Full Dura-Ace! Tested a Cannondale 6-13, and found that the 5.9SL Carbon was a smoother ride. The Cannondale may be stiffer, but if you want a smooth ride with a solid frame, OCLV 110 is the best! Considered a Cervelo R3, but the bottom bracket shell seperation on the 2.5 frame, steered me away.Buy Trek with confidence, lifetime warranty, Trek quality, and hopefully the company won't go into bankrupt protection like Cannondale. Trek has been making Carbon frames for around 10 years, so you can be assured that the frame will last.

Strength:
Trek's ability to improve on most aspects of a bikes' performance with the Madone should be commended. Lighter, Stiffer and more comfortable. Great bike.


Weakness:
The price is a bit steep. It's really a $4200 bike with a $1500 'Lance Tax'. The Paint and clear coat has some imperfections. Trek seems to have taken all the experienced painters and put them on Project One frames leaving the stock paint in the hands of the unskilled. Trek needs to address this.


This review is for the 2006 Madone SL 5.9Zipp stemKestrel OS carbon barsFull Dura-AceAm Classic cr-420 wheelsSLR saddle and Dura-Ace postChris King Headset I came directly off a 2000 5500 with all the same parts as the new Madone 5.9sl so the only change is the frame and fork. The 5500 was an excellent bike and the Madone 5.9sl is suberb. I don't buy into people's claims that this is the finest frame out there. It won't make you go 2 mph faster or climb like Lance. But then nor do I subscribe to it's detractors. The differences are evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Most aspects of this frame are an improvement over the 5500 and to most other bikes I've ridden. It's certainly lighter and stiffer in the bottom bracket. The headtube area is stiff but the frame absorbs road shocks without muting too much road feel. The fork is as good as my Reynolds pro on the 5500.

Weakness:
The bontrager race x-lite seat is a bit hard but I have the same seat on my 5.2sl and it has softened up with miles.


I just started riding my 2006 5.9sl Project One for the season. I have a 2005 5.2sl that I train on and wow! what a difference Durac-Ace and carbon stem, bars, race x-lite wheels make. This could be the coolest bike I have ever ridden. It is stable in the wind, it climbs as if I am on a flat road and it rides very solid yet damp. It feels like the wind is always at my back and it just wants to go. The carbon fork, stem and bars soak up all road vibration. I bought from a very knowledgable Trek dealer. I am stoked on this bike.

Strength:
Incredible stiffness when you puut power into it. It is flawless or at least the best I have felt so far. The bas and stem are as rigid as you could imagine and the BB seams liike there is no flex at all. This is a sprinters bike while being just under 17 lbs out if the store with old DA spd pedals. The wheels that it comes with are super quiet and only give a slight plink plink under heavy climbing efforts. 10 speed is just an incredible upgrade. Everything feels like it has power assist.


Weakness:
Seat post is really heavy at 205 grams considering it is a XXX lite! I have a regular bontrager carbon post from a filmore and it is only 10 grams more. I also did not like the seat so with my use post 135 grams and avocet seat the package is a bit more.Also I have weighed the stem and it is 20 grams heavier thatn my 10mm longer itm. The bars are also probably heavier but ihave not checked yet. The overall bike is an ounce or heavier than my old OCLV of the same size but I have not yet figured out what is the main culprit. My old one had a look fork ,ksyriums 8ti bolts plus da 9 speed. Probably just the slightly heavier post stem and bars and wheels.The saddle while light does not have anything to push off of when climbing.


Picked up this bike at great Demo price plus got a 400$ credit for crashed 1999 postal 5500 oclv frame. Trek is really great for giving me the 400$ credit!!! Incredible upgrade from my old OCLV which I had though was just about perfect. The ride is not quite as soft but the lateral stiffness is worth it. Power is not waisted on this bike!!!! I am 6 1 and 180 pounds and still strong enough to make most bikes flex .

Comfortable quick frame with terrific geometry and a great performance package. Trek's warrenty backing is second to none. And p.s. other manufacturers charge much more for the same or less.


Weakness:
When I'm not riding it I seem to waste time wheeling it around my living room making reving sounds.......is this bad?


06 bike. Terrific ride. This is a very light, efficient machine with a serious bent towards climbing. For those of you looking for a sexy looking ride this is not for you. Insofar as it is designed to perform a single function it is pretty bland on the aesthetic end of things but for those of us more concerned about performance this seems like a perfect bike. The frame is stiff yet compliant and the D.A. set-up is flawless. Simply stated this is the fastest and most comfortable racer out there. You still have to pedal uphill but it does everything a bike can do to get you to top as quickly and efficiently as possible. A thing of beauty.

Strength:
1. Super stiff frame and crank make incredibly efficient power transfer. Makes my old carbon Giant feel like it soaked up my efforts rather than putting them all to the road. Now everything feels like it is converted into speeeeed!

2. Stiffer fork and light carbon bars great for confident handling and communicating feedback to the rider- great on curvy descents.

3. Sensational looks. New laser etched Bontrager X-Lites with bare alloy hugi hubs look great against the dark blue/black Andromeda paint scheme.


Weakness:
1. Bontrager X-Lite pro saddle not the most comfortable still seem to be breaking it in after a few hundred kms! As always, saddle choice is very personal.

2. Rear hugi hub a little noisy.

3. Dark gloss paint scheme means I seem to be cleaning the bike all the time.


Fantastic bike, especially for me as I am a heavier rider (200lb)- super stiff and light with little flex makes for great power transfer, handling and feedback. Makes my old Giant's carbon TCR0 feel soft and vague. This is a bike that makes you want to do more kms everyday of the week.

Lite frame, comfortable and fast ride, great looking bike


Weakness:
Bontrager components are worethless, Race X lite wheels - ""lite"" must mean the weight of the rider neccessary to not flex the wheels. Customer support - there was none!


Great bike frame, great dura-ace components, Bontager components are not worth the money. Also Trek did not stand by their product. I informed them that the wheels flexed when climbing (to the point that they rubbed the brake) the best they could do was tell me that I must be mashing hard on the climbs! FOund stress fractures on the face plate of carbon stem, I have to wait for them to test the stem before they will issue a new one. Bontrager seat is terrible. Looks sleek and fast, but if ride for more than 40 miles on it expect to get sores on your back side. They ""gaurantee"" comfort. better read the fine print first. You spend top dollar and you expect to get top rate service, instead you get nada. Lance Rocks but I will never even consider another Trek a Huffy has better value.

Strength:
Unbelievably smooth ride for such a light, stiff frame.


Weakness:
A million other carbon Treks out on the road. Bontrager components (wheels, post, stem, bar, saddle, tires) have no cache, but in my limited riding on them, they seem to function well. The Bontrager tires were pretty sketchy in wet conditions.


I just picked up my new Madone 5.9 SL two days ago and went for my first extended ride on it yesterday. After 40 miles of some pretty good climbs, some screaming descents and plenty of hammering on the flats, I have to say this bike is damn near perfect.

My previous ride was steel and I was looking to get something lighter and stiffer but that could at least get close to the smooth ride I was used to. I narrowed my search to Cannondale's Six13 and the Madone and after the test rides it was no contest.

The Madone does everything well. It's UCI-weight-limit-light, ultra-stiff and yet somehow rides even smoother than the Reynolds 853 steel I've been on for the last 8 years. My only hang-up in getting the Trek was that everyone and his brother seems to have a carbon Trek since you-know-who started winning Tours. Now I understand what all the fuss is about.

Strength:
Light, stiff, responsive and ""steel like"" compared to other carbon frames. Carbon is far better than Ti. Andromeda paint is cool. This off the shelf bike is as good as it gets for the money.


Weakness:
High end bike should come standard with a Chris King Head set. The 5.9SL is the better bike, but lacks panache of Colnago because TREK makes a full spectrum of rides, not just the Tour dominator. Go for 7 Lance!


I came to this bike from a long list of steel frames and most recently a succession from a Litespeed Ti Classic and a TREK 5500 Postal/Dura-Ace '02. This 5.9 SL is lighter, stiffer and rides better than anything else. The Litespeed had a comfortable ride, but not nearly as light or stiff. (Notice that Litepseed is adding carbon to their chain stays) More surprising is the difference between the 5500 and the 5.9SL.

As for components the new 10 speed Dura-Ace is the best out there (aesthetics aside Record fans, it works better).

These are hard to find, I found one and bought it instead of waiting for a Project One.

Strength:
Light, stiff, responsive and ""steel like"" compared to other carbon frames. Carbon is far better than Ti. Andromeda paint is cool. This off the shelf bike is as good as it gets for the money.


Weakness:
High end bike should come standard with a Chris King Head set. Tone down the TREK stickers. The 5.9SL is the better bike, but lacks panache of Colnago because TREK makes a full spectrum of rides, not just the Tour dominator. Go for 7 Lance!


I came to this bike from a long list of steel frames and most recently a succession from a Litespeed Ti Classic and a TREK 5500 Postal/Dura-Ace '01. This 5.9 SL is lighter, stiffer and rides better than anything else. The Litespeed had a comfortable ride, but not nearly as light or stiff. (Notice that Litepseed is adding carbon to their chain stays) More surprising is the difference between the 5500 and the 5.9SL.

Strength:
Amazing lively high performance. Good solid comfortable ride. Fast and confident. Great climbing up or flying down the hills. Nice paint job but not great (""Andromeda"").


Weakness:
You can see the tube joints. The paint job is nice but could be better. Trek still uses the goofy steel chain stay protector which is a real dirt catcher. Aluminium fork tips would be nicer than the painted tips which soon become mashed looking.


This is a review of the 5.9 SL frame only. After riding the 5900 superlight for over 10,000 miles I swapped my components over to the 5.9 SL and have now ridden it for a couple of hundred miles. Big difference. I would describe this frame as lively, springy, responsive, solid, stiff but comfortable. It tracks very well on the downhills giving nothing but control and confidence. It absorbs the road chatter very well. Bigger bumps hit hard but the hit dissipates instantly, unlike the 5900 where the vibration energy of a hit lingers for a moment before dissipating robbing you of instant and accurate road connection and feel. I thought this characteristic of the 5.9 might translate into being banged up over a longer ride but it actually feels better. The vibration of a hit goes away as fast as it comes while on the 5900 it stayed awhile causing you to actually feel it more. While I cannot say the 5900 felt dead, I can say it felt pretty dead compared to the 5.9. I also noticed that the rear end stays planted on the road when standing and pulling hard on the pedals while the rear of the 5900 would sometimes jump off the ground spinning the wheel in the air. Put in a King headset and the front end is as smooth as butter. The weight of this bike fully built was identical to the 5900. The cable bosses are wider apart requiring less cable housing which may give better shifting/braking but I did not notice any difference. Any aero benefits claimed in the top tube shape were not felt.

Strength:
Liteweight, smooth ride, stiff rear end.


Weakness:
Haven't found any yet.


Wow what a ride! Carbon has the amazing ability to be stiff and yet forgiving. Out of the saddle this rocket takes off and it climbs like a billy goat. Love the compact gearing (in lieu of a triple) for the climbs in So Cal. Compared to my Litespeed Classic, it corners tighter and doesn't have that mushy feeling during the sprints, yet it's solid on the high speed decents. I rated it a 5 in both categories in camparison to other bikes on the market.

2005 Trek Madone 5.9 Superlight

I know there are many great bikes available these days, and the ""ulitmate"" bike is a matter of personal preference. That being said, I don't see how a bike could be significantly better for the type of mountain riding I do (gradients 8 - 12 percent extending for miles).

This bike climbs like a goat, accelerates with minimal effort, is stable and predictable on descent, and defies re-entry to the ""real world"" where worries and problems exist.

Dura Ace componentry is reliable and efficient - though not as zexy as Campy.

Bontrager fork, bars, stem, seat, and wheels are all top quality.

I wondered whether I'd notice the difference between the Madone 5.2 Ultegra triple and the 5.9 Superlight with a compact crank. Acceleration and responsiveness were noticeable, and that was a good thing since the 5.9 cost over 2 grand more. I'm not trash talking the 5.2 - it's a beautiful and worthy steed.

As for the argument against ""dead feel"" carbon - I humbly disagree with that. My take is that the material, design, and structure of the Trek frame/fork reliably dampens chatter and harshness - effectively reducing rider fatigue on long interplanetary journeys.

If you're looking for a dream bike - this is one to consider. Go with Project One, and it will probably send you out of this world.

Strength:
- unbelievable stability and strength- multiple geometry options for each size (H1, H2, H3 with more/less aggressive positions)- Ability to customize paint and components direct from factory (Project 1) - Example, I was able to pick a 12-26 cassette with standard cranks. 44cm bars versus 42cm, and the inform rvl saddle versus the new affinity one.- Lightweight (carbon, duh)-cost (yes, as a strength). it is a handbuilt, US frame with HIGH end carbon technology, and through project one, and the right component choices, you could built up the same frame for around $4000. value is there, even if not cheap.- Node 2 integrated computer system (all wireless, built into chainstay, including cadence, HRM, altitude and more)


Weakness:
- cost (yes, a con too). Even though reasonable compared to other high end carbon frames, it is still a lot, and still out of the range of the normal cyclist.- stock color pallete (I know, picky, but the stock colors were UGLY, part of why I got a project 1 so I could pick my own colors)- some 'suspect' part choices if you get a stock one (high end Bontrager wheels and componets are great. some lower end stuff not as much, especially mis tensioned machine built base wheels. also Bontrager R4 tires wear very fast - and this is compared to Vittoria Open CX clinchers!) in other words, it is hard to find a CON


WOW, simply WOWSo I have waited till I rode about 3000 miles on the bike, including a 600 mile, 7 day ride to write a review. A little about my riding. I dont get out of the saddle often. I sit, spin, and hammer. Try to keep a 90-95 cadence in any gear, and always push hard. When on big climbs (think crawford notch, NH), I wont get out of the saddle till the steep parts, and if I get under 10 mph. I am relatively smooth, but do push the pedals hard. My 6 series (project one, with a blue and white argyle paint job!) came in a bittersweet way. My 5 series project one Madone was stolen. I loved the 5 series, it was a good fit, light, responsive, and all LiveStrong colors! With that being said, the 6 series blows away the 5 series in every single way. Stability :(and this is in someway effected by component choice, I know). But the 6 series, downhill fast, in pacelines, feels SO much more solid and stable. 50+ mph descents with aero wheels, even with cross winds I did not feel twitchy. With the 5 series, over 40 mph, sometimes it felt twitchy, loose, and even scary. I would check the bike for a loose headset, or loose wheel bearings, because it did not feel stable (but it was just the bike)The 6-series improves on this in every way. Rock solid through everything I threw at it.Comfort : Yes, it is carbon. but it does not seem to beat you up. i am not a small rider (5'11"", 190-200 pounds), and the ride is comfortable. The 5 series almost seemed to stiff, where the 6 series is just SMOOTHER. With almost identical build kits, comparing long rides, I was less fatigued on the new one (the big ride I do is a 600 mile, 7 day Tour around New England, with huge climbs, through mountain passes, and along flats). strength : (and I say this versus stability). it never feels wavey when hammering or climbing. Like I said, I am not that small. Where at times the 5 series felt broken (i would check for cranks in the bottom bracket, stays, etc, since it seemed to be wishy washy - technical term! haha), the 6-series is ALWAYS solid.  It somehow manages to be stiff, strong, light, and comfortable.Overall, it is just a GREAT bike. I got the H2 geometry on this one (my last one was H1), so it is a 'little' more upright (countered by a negative rise stem with no spacers). I dont race anymore, and in my opinion, only racers should get the H1. it is aggressive. Dont be a hero, be comfortable! it just feels like I never have to worry about anything on the bike. It is strong, all around great, and I am not worried about damaging it, hurting it, or changing my riding style at all. The last thing, the integration of computer functions with the node computer is GREAT. The wireless sensor is built into the chainstay, and put a magnet on your crank. All normal cyclometer functions, plus the head unit uses the ANT+ standard, and covers cadence, reads the HRM strap, shows altitude, and more.

Strength:
It use to climb very well, accelerate on the decents like lighting and handle like a dream


Weakness:
The quality of the frame is rubbish, the fitting for the rear hanger is a joke and worst still when that breaks it snaps into the chain stays and writes off the whole thing. Several thousands down the drain.


I am lucky enough to have a couple of ride and decided what I wanted was an out and out race machine to see how fast I could cover distances. after looking around I bought a Trek Madone 6.9 but with a lower spec than standard ""only"" unsing ultegra parts and Race Lite wheels It went well to start with but after 14 months of riding and still on the original chain cassette etc (about 800 miles) the rear frame broke suddenly and the derailer smashed into the seat stay. The frame was sent back to trek and written off, wit hthe offer of a replacement at a mere £2500 (about $3500) of my money. The local bike shop has since told me they have had 2 back in 2 months with the same problem. The frame is currently with a carbon shop to see what they can do but the one thing I am certain of is Trek are never getting a penny more of my money.

Strength:
Very light, stiff in the sprints/climbs still compliant over very rough roads. Small frame size 52, and still feel it is compliant enough. In frame cable routing is very nice clean aero look to the bike, as well as the integrated dual sensor in the rear b-stay. Not one tie wrap on my bike...anywhere!!! Very nice custom paint job ( you can probably get your car painted for the cost of frame paint job, but still worth it, to not have bike, exactly like everyone else. Complimnets every time I ride with someone.


Weakness:
Price. Look for deals through your LBS/club/team, that should help ease the pain...a little.  Lawyer tabs on the the front fork.  Having to have decals(although they are under the clear coat, I would rather not have any at all, maybe just the Madone badge on the headtube at most.)


Finally a new bike that fits me. I had a professional bike fit before I even thought about what bike or size to buy. If your going to get a top of the line bike, you better make sure it is going to be right in every way, or your just wasting your money & time. I have had this bike for over a year now, & have not once wished I would of or could of bought something different. For me w/ the new fit, this bike was like night & day. I didn't get it until begining of June, so I all ready had sevral good months of riding/racing on my old 5.9SL. I noticed an imediate improvement for the performance of the bike. However, some of this was due to a very dramatic change in my position on the bike & also changing to a compact crank. No flex in the sprints or while out of the saddle climbing. ( Granted, I only weigh 140 lbs, but the frame is only a 52 cm & ways a 10th of what I do.) On my 6th ride on this bike I rode the ""Climb to Kaiser"" (155 mi., 15.5kft of climbing) & I was very comfortable all day long (10.5 hrs) It is a very fun bike to climb & an exciting bike to decend on . No price listed, as I already had, wheels,pedals,computer,saddle & componets.

So far I have to say I am super impressed with this rig! I had purchased a 5.5 and when I saw this go on sale a couple of months later my LBS was good enough to let me upgrade. Very responsive and stiff but not to the point of the bike killing you. Accelerates like its on fire and like others have said its a bit twitchy but that only took a couple of rides to become accustomed to. Added a pair of Reynolds DV46 Tubs which made it a bit more lively. All in all an excellent bike. Now I know how the pros feel.

Great bike, I love it. Super light, and responsive. But I will say that it is a fairly harsh ride. I came off a Cannondale CAAD 8 is it was a smoother and more comfortable ride for long miles.  The aeolus 5.0 wheels are freaking awesome. I wasn't sure I would like them because of their heavier weight, but these things just ROLL.

Strength:
BB90 is not just marketing fluff. That bottom bracket is so stiff that it's immediately noticeable. Sure its light but with this stiffness its incredible.


Weakness:
Just a bit of nervous handling compared to my older Madone.


Lost my first generation Madone 5.9SL after being hit by a car during a mid day training ride. Driver cited and insurance paid for damages so I replaced the cracked bike with a Project One Madone 6.9 SSL with Aeolus 5.0 wheels and SRAM Red.  Comparing the ride quality to my older Madone shows the evolution of stiffness and ride compliance both improve. Somehow the bike is stiffer and more compliant while being lighter. This translates to speed. Staying in pedal rhythm while riding over road imperfections is noticeable. Yet this isn't a noodle. Jump out of the seat and hammer up a hill and you'll be carrying a gear higher than you thought possible. There isn't any energy robbing flex going on here. The acceleration of a super light and stiff bike is just plain FUN. It's like holding a trump card and knowing you can throw it down when ever you need it. NICE!  Now being in the northeast its winter and my winter beater is doing my daily rides while the Madone sits in my bedroom waiting for the salty roads to get washed with spring rain storms.  Value is 5 as it has all the goods of a superbike at a price below many of the Euro brands.

Weakness:
As mentioned, seat post design is terrible where the seat is clamped and adjusted.


The seat post design SUCKS on this bike! I spent hours over the course of the first few months fiddling with it as it will never stay put and comes loose over time. While tightening the seat bolt, the seat will angle forward so you need to put serious backwards pressure on it to keep it lined up properly or else the saddle will be tight but pointing downward. It's a real pain in the ass. Other than that the frame itself is by far the best I've ever ridden or owned. It's sharp, agile, light and stiff in all the right ways but gives a great ride.

Strength:
Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, leaps tall mountains in a single bound. Look, up on the podium, is a Look, is it a Scott, no it's Super Madone, the Q-ship of the peloton! Near total customization, spectacular paint job, sets new standards in carbon frame design and manufacturing. Unmatched dealer network. My Baltimore MD dealer is a true gem. Joe's Bike shop (2 locations) is the best for fitting, service and customer care. I cannot say enough good things about my buying experience.


Weakness:
The excellence of the paint job makes me very paranoid about scratches and paint chips. I have to keep it in the house to feel the bike is safe. The garage is not good enough. Rear brake cable has much more friction than the front brake. This is probably part of the cable routing. I will see what my dealer can do about this. Aero wheels require 80 mm stem tubes. You must supply these since SAG support at organized rides is unlikely to stock these. I am also paranoid putting this bike in my work stand, due to possible paint scratching. I therefore clamp the seat-mast cap.


I'm a hard-core, 5+ rides a week, recreational rider, who does occasional time trials. I purchased a 2010 Madone 6.9 Project 1 in a magnificent Pearl White with Carrera Blue flame paint job. I could not be more impressed. Paint quality is flawless! This bike climbs as though it is pulling you up the hill. It is comfortable on long rides (my preference) and yet puts the power to the pavement when you get out of the saddle. Yes, I can feel some flex in front end when out of the saddle. My 220 lb bulk will exacerbate this so I do not have issues. My considerable torque fractured 2 Lemond Zurich frames at the dropout right rear dropout 6 years apart. Trek replaced the first one, and since Lemond is gone they credited me $1000 toward the Madone. This on a bike purchased 13 years earlier for $1375. This premium type of customer service on a bike that was 13 years old is most generous and should answer any questions one may have about the quality of Trek's customer service. Most excellent! I cannot say enough good about this bike. The in-frame cable routing sets a new standard in cycling. The frame is stiff in the sprint and yet comfortable for all-day. A truly masterful all-around performer. Mine is a 60cm pro-fit fame. Despite this large ride it weighed 15.5 lbs, no cages, pedals or computer. Freaky light! The Aeolus 5.0 wheels look great and you can just feel the aero advantage as speed increases. This bike just loves speed. Buy this bike if you just have to have the high-end AMG Mercedes Benz SLR of bicycles. Comfortable, reliable and wicked fast. A true road rocket. I don't know how they could improve this bike.

This was a team bike which varied slightly from the true 6.9, but not more than what many riders would do in terms of modifications. It’s a very good bike, a great stage racing bike, not really the best at anything, but performs well at almost everything. Very comfortable, nice aero design without going overboard. It does have some flex issues, particularly in the front. If your looking for a good sprinting frame, this probably is not it. The chain stays are also not quite as robust as I would have liked. The bike seems to be set up more for high cadence type riders, rather than those who like to push a big gear at low RPM, which is more my style. My one major complaint is the seat post. I like to use a specific type of post, which is impossible with this bike, and I also found the post to be a little too on the stiff side. The bike is already light enough that the weight savings are pretty much pointless as my bike ran 120g lead weights to meet regs anyway. So I could do without that.

Strength:
Great looking, Asymmetrical frame for better ride quailty, Redesigned frame OCLV2 for 2010, Stiff, Ride quality, Very light, Great looking, Handling, Duo Trap is awesome. Sexy bike that will get you from A to B much faster than anything else on the market.


Weakness:
Head tube is a lil flexy. I'd suggest going with the RXL stem instead of the carbon...it'll help with the flex feeling.


I did Treks Project One and am very very pleased with my bike. I was able to make the bike my own with paint schemes and ect... The big thing that sets this bike apart is the ride quality. Its stiffer than my 09 Tarmac Pro SL but doesn't beat you up on the longer rides. Its over a pound lighter also 14.5 with computer, cages and pedals, the Tarmac was 15.2 pounds without anything on it. It climbs better being lighter and still has the confident descending handling of the best bikes out there. I spent a lot of time on the Tarmac and really loved that bike, but everything about the Madone is better. Regardless of what kind of riding you want to do maybe racing crits or just long rides the Madone is where its at. I did go with the Mavic Ksyrium SL's though I don't like the way Bontrager wheel sets feel (lil to flexy).

Strength:
Great Lines and extremely light weight


Weakness:
Structuraly questionable and extremely poor customer service


On my second day on the bike coming back from my second ride (less than 40 miles total on the bike) I stopped a t a red light. Once the light turned green, I clipped in and jsut made it across the intercestion when I heard a loud snap and came to a screeching halt. I looked down and the frame was resting on my back tire and my derailleur was hanging off the chainstay.The bike had failed at the drive side seatstay / chainstay junction - not at the derailleur hanger but actually the carbon junction.Devestated by this turn of events, I was somewhat bouyed by the thought of Trek's custoemr service. I returned the bike to the dealer for a new frame and derailleur and was surprised to learn that this catastropic failure was not covered under the warranty. I was shocked since I had a 2004 5500 prior to purchasing the new bike and bought the second Trek based on my customer experience experience. I was informed that not only would I not get compensated for a new derailleur, but that I would have to pay an $80 repair fee to get my brand new frame fixed, pay for the tear down, shipping both ways and rebuild as well.Beware stay away from this model and Trek in general.

I rode this bike in the roads in NYC, Colorado Rockies and the rolling hills of Seattle. Loved every mile of it. It's fast as a Ferrari but rides steady as a Rolls Royce. After doing 100 mile ride, I feel I can go 50 more but have to go home sometimes. I was surprised by the carbon wheels and how it can be used every day. It's definitely at least 2 to 4 mph faster gain cruising past 20mph compared to my Mavic ES using the same effort and road conditions.

Freaky lite,stiff, oversized head tube, bottum braket, seat mast feels very smoth, climbs like it wants to pull you up the hill, decends on rails.


Weakness:
Retail price


2008 Madone 6.9 with Durace and Race X-Lite wheels. Keo Sprints, 175mm cranks, 44cm XXX bars. I am coming off a 2007 Madone SL 5.9. Great bike but at 190lbs. I found the front end too flexy. Could watch the fork bend backwards 2cm under braking. Fast downhills were not fun as I could not hold a line very well due to flex. Got a smokin' deal on the 6.9 and went from 58cm down to 56cm. 5'10.5"" 33"" inseam and the 56cm fits great. Took it to the Colorado National Monument last weekend. Climbed up from Fruita over and back. While the 5.9 SL climbs well, when I stood up for the 1st time on the 6.9 my mouth took over and without thinking I said ""WOW"". You read about bikes that propel you foward but you never believe it. Believe me, the 6.9 did just that. Seated climbing felt more effecient as well. I dialed it in to the measurements I like and it felt like I had been on it all my life. I met a freind of mine who is a pro cyclist and we went back down to Fruita. While he beat me to the bottom, the 6.9 would not flex even when I intinially tried to flex it. Held a line without issue. I expected some creeky sounds since the entire cockpit is carbon but nothing doing. I have been riding since 1986 and have owned steel, al.,al. carbon combos and carbon. I was specptical that a bike could really make that big of a difference but I am humbled, this thing is good at everything. I am not a big Trek guy but I have to admit, they got this one right. Huge difference between the 2007 SL 5.9 and the 2008 6.9. Totally different realm. I am surprised it is still called a Madone because it is a totally different bike.Get one if can.

Strength:
Handling, power transfer, stability, and weight. Most of my rides have been training rides of 85 miles or less, but do include two races of approx 25 miles each. I am 6'1"" and 190 lbs with 40 years racing experience. It really handles. Those 90 degree corners in a tight pack are no problem. Power transfer makes climbing good and the weight does not hurt in this catagory.  Stability at 60 mph+ is very good. The bike does feel like a light bike, but does not get knocked around or feel skittish. The sprinting on this bike requires a bit of finess as the front end squishes with high power out of the saddle gear mashing hammering. It is best to rock the bike a little to avoid perpendicular force on the steerer. The bottom line is that TREK hit an in park home run. This is an all day ride that will do anything you throw at it. Seatcap design beats the heck out of cutting the seat post! I personally like it and have not noticed the softness that some have complained about.


Weakness:
Several weaknesses. Proprietary BB bearings are an issue. It is a great idea, but TREK needs to have all models without back orders. Not everybody uses Shimano cranks. Proprietary fork means that the soft steerer can not be solved with an aftermarket fork. The fork itself is fine, but the steerer is pretty flexible. I actually returned the bike for a warranty check as I was concerned the steerer had not been manufactured correctly. Need a more supportive top cap on the steerer. This would help the flexible steerer. Note the steerer problem only is noticeable during hard out of the saddle efforts. This may be a personal taste/size problem. See sprinting under strengths.


This is for the 2008 6.9 performance fit frameset with approx 900 miles. Frame is excellent. Front end is a little soft for my tastes, but eats chip seal and for longer rides works out. TREK got it right.


Similar Products Used:
Lots of road bikes with many brands. Best frame I have EVER owned is a Parlee Z3. If I did not have the Parlee the TREK might be the best.

Got the bike about three years ago and barley touched it the first year. The second year i started getting into it a lot more. Im now in my second year of serious riding and getting into racing. Overall the bike is decent with fairly good handling, acceleration, and build quality. At its price you can't do much better. However if you want to get into racing it is pretty easy to max this bike's abilities. I would highly suggest buying a better bike if your intent is racing. But if your looking for a quick weekend cruiser or a solid commuter look no further. (to be fair I am comparing this bike's racing abilities to a Cervelo RS that I tested, and while there is an enormous price gap between the two bikes like the Cervelo or the Felt F5 are that much better)

This is my first road bike as I cut my teeth on MTBs. So this will be skewed from a newbie perspective; might help a MTB convert though. I love the trim on the front derailler to silence chain-rub noise. It sized smaller than expected on me; 5'11"" and got a 54cm, LBS said a 56cm may have also fitted me but I didn't want to be too stretched out. Sora components are cheaper but I can replace those w/ Dura-ace later and I plan to. The Sora shifters are bullet-proof according to the LBS, but I don't like not haveing the addt'l lever in the drop down position. These will be my first upgrade. Tires do not inspire confidence at first. Lighter wheelset will be second upgrade. The good news is the frame is strong and has a lifetime warranty so it's a great platform for the future.

I haven't ridden in 7 years and decided a new ride would get me back on the road. I looked around and had a fair amount of sticker shock. I managed to cut my cost by buying last years model. The bike suits me fine. I am a big guy. The saddle and pedals were both too small. I upgraded both and am much happier. Having never owned an indexed shifting system, I was really surprised at how much of a difference it made.

This was my first road bike after a long gap of no cycling and it got me going again.It was good value for money but is an entry level bike. Perfect for first time road riders but you'll want to upgrade fairly soon. Although it is a heavy bike, on club rides and in races you can keep up with/beat bikes costing 10x the amount. Due to it being a cheap bike, it is built with cheap/low end parts.stuff does wear out. The drive train gave me hassle, poor shifting and alignment issues were common and the bottom bracket started to wear after 8 months. This bike was written off in a crash, but will be missed a lot!

the bike is a 2009. fifteen years ago, i was a road racer and biathlete/ and raced a kestral all carbon and way ahead of its time...got the bug again and bought a 1.2 trek after riding a cannondale mt bike. the trek feels very good with a carbon fork and seat post but the cheap drive train sticks out like a sore thumb. the main culprit is the front derailer that will not shift the triple chain rings on any regular basis. this is fixed by replacing the no name shimano with shimano ultegra triple front and the shifting improves dramaticaly. the brakes are also weak and noisey as the pads pick up road debri and don't stop the bike with any confidence...this is fixed by changing the pads to durace for 20.00 brakes then are more than acceptable.. this is a nice bike for the money but trek would be much better off to upgrade front derailer and brakes not to mention the seat which did not last a day with me..

Strength:
so far it has done me 150 miles and climbs really well handles like a dream and and the tyres and wheels are ok and have stayed true despite some rought roads where i live .


Weakness:
right ,the pedals are to narrow ,need new pedals as i keep touching frame with my heel and crank when pedaling ,the seat is painful, after 150 miles i noticed a knock from the front (tightened headset and now seals ok) the nice white bar tape dont stay that colour ,the front derailour is stiff to change from the 50 to 34 ring , the bike is slow would benifit from a 39/53 front set and a 32/11 rear set would make it better all round but still had only 3 weeks and need to make it mine so to speak.


new 2010 trek 1.2 compact 50/34 front and 11/26 rear bought 3 week ago machine looks nice and the price is not to bad although it could have come with a decent seat for £600

Weakness:

I only bought this bike because of the price. I've always wanted a road bike and was about to buy a Specialize sequia, but this bike was a few hundred dollars less. Great bike if you are starting cycling. Has great performance, but I have'nt really rode any mid to high end road bikes before.

Strength:
Handles well, with good acceleration.


Weakness:
Front derailleur gives trouble shifting and is very noisy


I am new to riding (started in August 2008 - 7 months ago) so I did not quite know what to expect from a road bike. That said I am now addicted to the sport and will be competing in my first race this month. The guys at the bike, all active road racers, recommended this bike and fitted me. I changed out tires to the bontrager race lite set and found that my ride feel improved. It's hard to comment on the seat because I don't have a frame of reference but after 30 miles or so, I begin to wonder if there is a better alternative. The one big drawback though in the front derailleur. It's noisy and often gives trouble shifting, especially on hills. other than that, I am a happy camper and expect to upgrade to Madone 5.5 once I get a couple of races under my belt.

Strength:
Fast and light (got a speeding ticket). Reasonably priced. Great Frame to build up, when drivetrain eventually breaks down. Loved the white frame over the black. The thumb shifters are constantly beat up on this board and others, but for my cold rides with the penguin mitts I wouldn't be able to shift the small finger levers on ""better"" shifters. I can now change tires on the fly pretty quickly (see below). For me the fit was perfect, just spend time at the LBS to get fitted.


Weakness:
After 5 or 6 flats like most people here, I got rid of the junk stock tires, and put on some Vittoria 700 x 28 ($80). These aren't fast tires, but overall due to no repairs since then I am much happier. With the original tires, I thought I was having bad luck with glass on the road or something, but after further research I found out they were junk. Trek cut corners with the 8 spd setup that is next to impossible to upgrade 1 piece at a time, which it looks like they have corrected for 2009 (sora front and back, and 9 spd). That saddle…The original brake pads - loud, chatter, wore out in a few weeks, put on some heavy duty pads for $30, and no problems. The white bar tape looked awesome before the 5 or 6 flats, now it is grey. Rear rim has needed truing quite often.


Bike is 2008. A great ride. A fine way to get into road bikes or update an oldie. Have probably put 2500 km (1500 miles) on it since Spring. Use it as my preferred mode of transportation, commuter bike (retired the mountain bike), and have gone on some 4 hour rides. Love the speed, handling, shifting (love hate), ultra light frame. I bought Zinn's Guide to bike Mtce and keep the bike in good working order. Slowly transitioned to the clipless pedals and it is the way to go. The triple up front is great for the hills that I ride, can do most in the 39 (50/39/30), but when I'm tired it is nice to have the granny. Now I will probably go for a 50/34. On the shifting note, most of the time it does alright, but the front does take a while and it has a big clunk to it when shifting under a hard load - hills. I went into the store to buy the Giant OCR 3, but walked out with this one due to the better fit for me. Bottom line, buy the 2009 when it hits stores instead of a discounted 2008 (see below), unless you can get a used one cheap and then build it up when you want. The front derailleur needs lots of attention, which I give it. The rear sora is fine. I haven't rode a steel frame, but this alum frame bounces all over the place on the not so nice paved path to work, don't know if steel will make a difference.

Strength:
Looks, carbon fork, it's a Trek


Weakness:
Money sink, might as well just buy the frame because *everything* needs to be upgraded


Taken to the cleaners! If this is your first go at serious cycling, be prepared to shell out *well over* $1,000… and keep on paying. These bikes (and this one in particular) are like Jaguars from the 1980s - fancy, impressive & fun… temperamental, frustrating & *needlessly* expensive. I had this bike for 3 months and loved it for a while. However, for anyone new to cycling, be prepared to upgrade both the tires and the tubes. I didn’t know I was supposed to and, after a period of incessant flats (yes, I checked the tire before replacing), I was really turned off by the sport. Many suggest upgrading the brakes on the 1.2 as well. There are so many upgrades you’ll need to make (pedals, seat, tires, tubes), then you’ll have to buy special cleats for the pedals, a helmet, multi-tool, spare tubes, computer/odometer, over-priced clothing, lights, bottle cage, bottle, seat bag, pump. After you’ve done all of this, you’ll probably either have a few flats or it will be time to replace the brakes. The sport is a money sink & it doesn’t have to be. This isn’t a Schwinn or a Huffy. It should come with a functional seat, proper pedals, durable tires, durable tubes and decent brakes. These bikes are capitalist RACKETS! As good as it felt riding this new Trek around, I felt I was burning a slow hole through my wallet. I felt I was being taken advantage of. The law of averages means you can go months w/o a flat. It also provides for you having 3 flats in one week. This gets real old/expensive real quickly. What’s more, changing the tire is no easy task and you’re hands will get dirty. No big deal, except for the fact that the handlebars are WHITE! (Jaguar - pretty, flashy, not functional) I took my bike to the bike shop and even they had a hard time changing the tire. Just when I was in my 50th km, I’d get a flat & knew all that momentum was die down for a frustrating experience. What’s more, the front derailer required two shifts and clicked quite often, even after professionals adjusted both of them. It may be an entry-level road bike, but no Trek should need this many upgrades. I sold my Trek on Ebay for the same price I bought it for. I bought some Nikes for running & a weight rack for a few hundred more, but I’m making all that money back because my Nike’s last and I need no upgrades.

I like the bike's speed. The frame is very stiff for the money. Rear deraileur works fine and shifts smoothly. The front deraileur can be noisy if not dialed in correctly. The crank did work loose after about 800 miles but LBS fixed it.

Strength:
Great value. Rides smooth. Rear dérailleur shifts well, with a good tuning.


Weakness:
The saddle is hard and uncomfortable. I suggest upgrading the seat right away. Also it is difficult to upgrade drive train without replacing the entire list drive train components. The Trek 1.2 comes in Sora 8 speed and nearly all superior components are incompatible with 8 speed, or the triple crankset.   Like other reviewers I thought the front dérailleur was a bit noisy. Luckily, this is a cheaper component to upgrade.


I've been a long time competitive runner and wanted to get into cycling for the purpose of triathlons. Decided to first get a road bike and see how I take to the sport. Entry level bike just made sense.   After reading a bunch of reviews, and with consideration of budget, decided to get the Trek 1.2, that was 5 months ago. I've learned a ton about cycling since the purchase, both from experience and from local cyclists.

Strength:
Handling, feeling on the road, weight, and overall design.


Weakness:
I read negative reviews on Sora Derailleurs and brakes, but once they were dialed in they work fine.  Not top of the line components, but if your just looking for a good ride, and not trying to shave a millisecond off your time it’s a great bike. You can lock up the wheels with the brakes, and the breaks are much better than my old 1987 Cannondale, and the shifters are definitely better than what came on my Cannondale. Don’t be scared by the negative reviews, just make sure the bike shop has an enlightened mechanic to set everything up.


Perfect bike for a fitness buff who loves to ride, and doesn't want to spend a fortune.

Strength:
Nice bike for the money. My experience was not the best, but fellow riders ride similar models without complaint.


Weakness:
Front derailer is noisy.


Bought the 2008 model a few months ago. I'm new to riding. Began riding this bike 5 miles at a time. Now riding 50-100 miles/week. Front derailer shifted poorly. Could not shift into all 3 chainrings. After some adjustment, I got it to shift. Returned it to bike shop to adjust for cable stretch. That helped too, but my bike seemed to be the only one making any noise in the group. Even with all that, still couldn't consistently change into all 3 chainrings.  I changed the saddle for something more ergonomic. I kept the stock tires and intended to use them until I started having problems. I had 2 flats in the 3 months of riding. Front hub also seem to have some noise from friction. It turned out that my Trek that was sized was several cm too small. After getting some serious numbness after 50 mile rides, I returned again to the bike shop to check the fitting. They did make it right. Got to trade it for a Specialized Allez Double for about $30 extra. Specialized seems to give you a few extras for comparable money. I'm actually happy about the trade and that the shop made me whole.

Strength:
I've got about 1,000 miles on it and I love it. It's comfortable to ride, climbs like an angel and is really responsive when you pound on it. Shifting is quick and positive. Nice audible feedback. I really notice the weight difference from my old Lemond Tourmalet (1995)


Weakness:
None that I can see so far. The handlebar is a little short on the drops. I like to go to the drops for downhills and my hands feel like they are falling off. Also, saddle is a bit weird, but I suspect that would be the case with almost any bike.


After shopping at the LBS and trying to decide between a new (2008) Roubaix Elite or a Madone 4.5, I checked ebay on a lark and found this one, three years old. I bid with less than 5 minutes to go and won it for $1975 plus $65 shipping. Other costs: $65 for LBS to build it (it came professionally tore down and boxed) and then $50 for a professional fitting and another $45 for a stem to put me in the right riding position. According to the bike fitter, ""you got a great deal, this bike fits you like a glove"". The bike had less than 1,000 mile on it. It was too big for the guy. There is hardly a scratch on it and it looks brand new. He bought a new Madone and switched out its Ultegra for the Dura Ace that was on the bike he sold me.So, I got the Ultegra. Not a problem for me. Also came with Chris King headset, and Bontrager Race Lite wheels. I'm 57 yrs old, 240 lbs and 20-yrs ago did a number of triathlons on a relatively cheap bike. This is the first really high end bike I've owned. I'm not a fast rider and just like being out for a few hours, being comfortable, and occasionally really hammering.

Strength:
Lightness, stiff frame with the unmistakeable carbon comfort.


Weakness:
Bontrager compenents are very poor, and giving a second chance I would select Shimano only. The chain (crank) rings peeled their finish within weeks, and the free replacement offered by the dealer followed very soon afterwards. The Bontrager hubs also peeled paint suggesting overall poor finish. However no grouse over the bars, stem, seat post, saddle and wheels (but maybe I should have stuck to Ksyrium)


This bike is firm and fast. It handles well on tight bends at speed, and its lightness makes it highly manouverable. I have the largest 62 frame which combines comfort with optimum riding position.

Looked at all current materials availble in frame building. Have only ridden aluminum in the past and wanted a change.

When I got my 5.9 (first time on Dura Ace) I was shocked to say the least. I was out to buy a bike of a life time to last just as long and found all of that and a bag of chips in the Modone 5.9! I've just upgraded to some Dura Ace carbon tubulars. I'll let ya know what I think of them when the weather breaks (she doesn't go out in the rain!).

Strength:
comfortable, good warranty and support, stiff, handles well, good wheels, light overall. Stock tyres lasted well, was unexpected. But I am weak rider and weigh ~66kg so I am relatively easy on equipment. Great carbon seat-post with ~2.5mm height markings.


Weakness:
geometry is a little odd, long TT, short S/T and short H/T so I have 30mm of spacers as a result. Has a rather steep STA for 54cm, 74 degrees. Would prefer 73 or 73.5. The standard bars drop too deep for most riders I see, myself included. I dont like the look of the aero seat tube.


Overall happy with my Madone 54 cm bicycle after ~5000km. The finish is not great given the price, some scratches on surface and paint is not perfect but otherwise a fine bike. Good ride quality, stiff, etc. Much better than it's rider. The only odd thing is long top tube relative to seat tube and a short head tube meaning most riders end up with more spacers than other makers of bikes. It is mainly a visual issue though. If you do not have good flexibility and hence can tolerate decent saddle to bar drop and you hate spacers or a flipped up stem then you may want to avoid Trek Madones. Else it's a buy. Standard saddle is not good for my behind so Fizik is used.

Are you kidding?


1st Off. I resisted switching from my 1981 Alpine Columbus tube and cinelli lugged steel frame. Campy super record Down tube shifters Mavic open pro wheels. It is the the engine not the bike I said over and over. I raced some as a Cat 3 15 years ago. I did my share of tri's I was pretty sucessful usually top 5%. Well it is back on the bike after 4 years of white water Kayaking. Since June I have shed 20 pounds. I chose to reward myself with a brand new 2004 Trek 5.9 left desserted on the LBS shop floor. Dropping 8 POUNDS on the weight of a bike is a big deal. My AVS. over a TT course that I hit on the week nights has improved by 1.9 mph. avs Nobody was more surprised than me. I thought it was the engine remember. My riding buddy was really bummed as he was startled by my jumps for the sign. While in a pace line I was so used to a certain effort that was necessary to hold that 3-6 inch gap imagine my surprise when I was constantly advancing into an overlap situation with the wheel ahead. It turns quicker. It is stiffer. It shifts better. Its just as comfy. As my state of the art 1981 steel bike.
If there is any way of getting on one of these do it. Get your own cause I'm not sharing. Excellant Product!!!!!!!!!!!

Weakness:
When you fall in love in a Madone, you constantly warry about her wellfare and tender skin. But that’s part of the game called love...


It was love at first sight! A dazling Madone in red, white and black. What a beauty!
It took some time to tame her, or at least come to a mutual agreement. The first month she tempted me to go way beyond my regular training zones. No respect at all. By the time I learned that I had to ride hard - real hard! Only then she would reveil her hidden qualities and giving you your reward.
Turning the copplestone areas to a sweet massage, and in the steep climbs she make me smile at 53/15. On the flats I can ride her at a heavier gear than usual with ease. Compared to my old flames she is a real living thing - with soul. Flexing and soft at the right spots and stiff and stubborn where she is suposed to be. Sensing the surfaces below and my intentions above. Her Bontrager and Shimano jewels suits her well, making me proud when the other guys turns heads. But best of all; she has made in great shape and I look forward to our next meeting. My sweet Madone!
Our relation gives meaning to the statement: ""It’s not just a bike, it’s a TREK!""

Strength:
Very smooth ride. Most road vibrations are eliminated. Great warranty response.


Weakness:
None


I've owned this bike for about six months now and I love it. I commute to work on a different bike and save this one for weekend pleasure rides.

After about 1500 miles the bike developed a six inch crack on the bottom of the down tube. The crack was completely through the carbon. The bike had never been crashed or even tipped over. I'm about a 190+ lbs rider. I suspect it was some sort of manufacturing defect.

My Trek warranty experience couldn't have been better. As soon as I discovered the crack I took the bike to the Trek store in La Mesa. They were surprised by the flaw and stated that it's the first one they've seen with a crack like that. They processed the paper work on a Mon. Trek reviewed the paper work on Tues, and a replacement frame was in the mail on Wed. The new frame arrived within two weeks and the guys at Trek La Mesa swapped the frame in less than 24 hours. 

I'm a little concerned by the defect, but my warranty experience was so good that I will overlook it as a fluke. I have a Trek 9.8 mountain bike that I spectacularly wrecked at 25+ mph. I had a broken arm, but the carbon frame only had a couple scratches. So I haven't lost any confidence in Trek or carbon.

Thank you very much to Matt, Mark, and Troy at Trek La Mesa, CA. for the great service!

Even though I had a frame failure, I'm still giving a 5 for overall rating because Trek was so responsive with the warranty.

Very stiff frame, without harshness. Custom paint (Mountain Storm) is incredible. Draws a crowd with comments on paint quality.


Weakness:
You can't throw it down anywhere once you get somewhere because you might wreck the beautiful paint. Can't leave it out anywhere 'cause some goober will steal it and sell it for $50 worth of meth.


I went from my Trek 5200 to this bike expecting a similar ride. What a mistake that was. Trek has once again pushed the envelope on performance and comfort in a racing bike. This bike absorbs the bumps sooo much better than my 5200! The ride is smooth, the frame much stiffer. You can really feel the difference over slightly broken pavement. Much less harshness is transferred to the handlebars. When you get out of the saddle and mash the pedals in a sprint the frame doesn't flex beneath you like a noodle like so many bikes can.

This bike has great handling - very stable but quick if you need it. It's super light, very stiff at the botton bracket and the frame absorbs vibrations from the road. It climbs beautifully. Dura Ace 10 speed is a major upgrade from 9.

This is a GREAT bike - buy one.

Strength:
Sweetness of ride - Lite - Stiff - Fast


Weakness:
You have no place to hide from hearing ""It's not the bike""


How can a racing bike be soooo comfortable? If you love the feel of steel for its ability to soak up the vibration and think that Carbon frames are dead in feel, then look to this bike. It blew me away with the way it soaks up the road vibration and cracks in the pavement. I see how you could ride this bike on a fast century or long rec ride and not feel beat up as I did on my old Cannondale. I got the bike with the Bontrager compact crank. I wanted Dura Ace but I got such a good deal on this bike that I figure if I don't like compact I can purchase the Dura Ace crank and ebay the Bontrager. So far I actually like the compact crank. It really helps on the way home after I just wasted myself on a group ride ;-) It should help with Whiteface hill climb in June as well...

The cockpit is Bontrager carbon bars and carbon stem. Not quite the eye candy of an FSA unit but very stiff and functional. Now how often do you hear about a rave on handle bar tape? Even that stuff is sweet. 

The stock paint I went for was called Andromeda. It’s a blue black metal flake flip flop color that changes depending on the light hitting it. Its much MUCH nicer than the team color. 

Overall if you are looking to spend some coin on a bike that can do fast rides that won’t beat you up then this is the machine.

Wow! I thought the 5200 was a good bike, but this thing is incredible. Its just so stiff at the rear. When you dance out of the saddle, each pedal stroke seems to propel you forward up the climb. When I first fitted a computer to the bike, I noticed I was 1-2 miles an hour faster on average with no extra effort.This is an incredibly quick bike. If your riding any machine other than a Madone and one appears alongside you, be affraid!.

harsh ride period. rear dropout quality, crank bearings(drag)


I have about 400 miles now on a demo 2005 trek madone 5.9 The bike is fast, it gets up to speed a little quicker than most other bikes I have had. I love the wheels, they are bontrager raxe x lites in an aero rim style. It is a very ucforgiving bike though. It pounds the rider more than any other bike I have used. Very noticeable from about 40 miles on. The dropouts were slightly crooked in the frame causing a perfectly dished wheel to not line up in the frame. The bontrager carbon cranks were stiff and light but the bearings drag badly, I don't know if this would slow you down but compare them to a smooth rolling bottom bracket and it is night and day. Overall the bike is good, it is a hard charging race bike bike not smooth enough as an all day bike or recreational bike.

This is an update to my previous review. trek sent me a new frame as per warranty as my rear wheel was out of align. Now both wheels are going the same direction, and this is a good thing. 

 If I were Bruce Almighty, and by devine intervention could sprout the perfect bike from my butt, this is it. the bike exceeds all expectations, in all tasks. 

 See my previous review for other thoughts, but, if you are considering a new bike, look no further, you wont be dissapointed.

Haven't found a thing this bike can't do with excellence


Could a bike be any better? I don't think so. I'm 6'4"", 207, and after riding steel, aluminum, and a few years of Titanium, which I thought was the ultimate material, I am now convinced that carbon is the ultimate, The bike is completely obediant for whatever task you could ask of it, and thats what a true race bike should be. There is no dead wood fell, I would compare it closer to the stiffness of aluminum with the dampning of carbon. See my review of my 2004 litespeed vortex, dura ace 10 if you are considering anything Ti, or from the American Bicycle Group. 
 
 I have to tell you that it was hard for me to buy a Trek, being that there are so many around here. But I can say, It was the best decision I've made in bicycles lately. I rationalized the amount of research that has gone into it's design, and I know Trek will be there if I have a problem or warranty issue.

Light weight helps on hills(for taller or heavier people). Great aero looks. Top Shimano components.


Weakness:
Not many, the only thing I can say is if you plan on riding on normal streets you may want to invest in a new heavier duty wheelset, as the bontrager's tend to go out of true fairly easily.(to be expected)


Once you ride a bike of this quality it really spoils all others. Great looks, Top components. I'm a taller guy, so the lighter weight of the bike made huge improvements on my hill climbs. Only draw back is the friends who think your crazy for spending as much on a bike as some do on cars. But on this bike you'll get places faster than you would in that car anyway.

And then there are the dura-ace parts. Nothing shifts like dura-ace. Nothing feels like dura-ace. And nothing holds up as well as dura -ace. And it is all backed up by a terrific company, Trek. My dealer also went above and beyond what I expected. Not only did I get a good price, but I got good service!

Great handling on all terrain, comfortable, light and very responsive.


Weakness:
Paint(or lack of it)is very easily chipped, but heh it is a road bike, have you a bike that has no stone chips?


Where do you start? I previously owned and in fact still own a 5500 with 9spd Dura Ace. This was a very good bike and still is. So is the Madone better? In one word yes! This bike is excellent, I ordered mine in September 2003 and did not receive it until March 2004 and beleive me it was worth the wait.

I had considered and tried a few other bikes e.g Pinarello Dogma, Litespeed Vortex, Time VXRS etc but once I rde the Madone I knew I had made the right choice(although all the other bikes mentioned were super machines). 

Instead of buying an off the peg steed I opted to build the bike to my specification and would like to think I have done a good job. The bike is very responsive and just loves to accelerate on all terrain, Ascents, Descents, Flats.
Changing of direction at high speed are no problem and the comfort is as good as the 5500 although potential purchsers should be aware this is a real race bike through and through so some extra stiffness is to be expected. If you purchase enjoy because this is truly a great ,machine and remember you have the extra kudos of saying that Lance helped design it!

Climbing, Sprinting, Ride Quality, Stability on Decents.


Weakness:
Paint finish not on par with other bikes costing $4,500.


The Madone is somewhat majical. Compared to my 5200 the bike feels similar when seated. However, once you exit the saddle and start to hammer the bike seems to launch forward like no other bike I have ever ridden. Standing climbs and sprints are the biggest reward in this bike (which for most of us is where significant time gains are made). Additionally the stability of the frame on rapid decents is head and shoulders above the 5200/5500 frame. I did not notice any loss of comfort on this bike compared to my 5200 and felt I could easily spend 4-5 hours in the saddle. My only beef with the bike is the finish work Trek applies to the exterior which is sub-par for a bike of this magnitute (price).

Now that I no longer race, I think I'll wait for the 5.2 Madone to come out this fall/next spring. A slightly heavier version of the same frame with Ultegra group components...all for approx. $2,800 after LBS discount.

Weakness:

Previous reviews mention detail finish, but on mine, the finish is great.


I just got back into cycling as I have started triathlons and wanted to update my old bike. I shopped lots of stores and brands. The staff at the shop where I bought the Madone were fantasitc. They spent hours with me. Although I only test rode a Trek 5200, I loved the ride so much I put a deposit down for a Madone, even though I had not ridden one. Since I have had it, I am truly amazed at how great a ride this is. I am 6'2"", about 190 lbs and ride the 62cm frame. The difference between my old Al frame and the OCLV carbon is tremendous. I used to cringe going over bumps on the Al frame, but the carbon absorbs all the shock from the road. The saddle took one ride to get used to, but is comfortable for me. 
The bike climbs tremendously and the acceleration is phenomenal. 
The first tri I used the bike in, my bike time improved significantly. Avg. speed is about 17% greater than old cycle. 
Shimano Durace shifting is quite crisp, although I do notice occassionally when down shifting from 8 to 7th on the 11-23 cassette that you have to shift harder than normal or it may not down shift. I purchased the Durace 7800 pedals with the bike and have been extremely pleased with them as well.
The best thing I can say is that everytime I get off the bike, I can't wait for the next time I get to ride it again...

Strength:
Stiff, yet comfortable. Good quality wheels. Definitely an efficient machine, probably a combination of low weight and some aero advantage.


Weakness:
Team logo saddle. Poor finish quality.


First of all, I've been riding this as my primary bike for about six weeks. Where I live it is VERY WINDY! So, I am pleased to say that this bike delivers. 

This frame is super stiff and silly light. I thought my Ti bike was stiff, but this baby just juts forward when you get out of the saddle. I really believe it is more efficient than my other bikes. I consistently ride about 1 mph faster on this bike than I do on my Ti bike. They are both outfitted similarly. DA 10 is slightly better than DA 9 but not much.

I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Bontrager wheels. They are light and spin up well. Certainly they are just as good as my Ksyriums. Likewise, the seatpost and handlebars are also good quality offerings on this bike. They don't flex under load and they are comfortable.

Although the ""wooden feel"" of the carbon fiber is here, this frame is so stiff sometimes I feel as if I'm on Aluminum. However, the carbon somehow dampens the vibrations, and at the end of the ride I don't feel beaten up. Amazing!

I wish that Trek wouldn't slap a Postal saddle on all their high end frames. I mean we are all posers, but there are limits! I personally found the Aspide to not be comfortable, so I spent the extra 35 grams and went with a WTB saddle. Needless to say saddles are a very personal thing, but for me this bike took on a much more comfortable character with a little extra padding (did I mention this frame is stiff?)

My only real complaints are two. First, the headset. Please, just charge me an extra fifty and put on a King. Why cut such a little corner on this Ferrari? Secondly, the finish on this one is pretty poor. I can seams, the finish is uneven. Again, why not put your absolute best foot forward in your flagship offering?

Overall, this bike is fabulous. It is as good if not better than anything currently available. I'm sure Trek will get the kinks in the finish worked out after demand dies down a bit. This bike performs at a 5+ level. For the weak finish I have to give it a 4.

Kudos to the guys at Blue's for great customer service!

Weakness:
Not excatly the most exclusive bike on the block. Deatil finishing. Trek should send their factory heads to visit Pinarello.


Nice bike. You can feel it leap forward as you put pressure on the pedals to acceleerate and the lightness and stiffness means that it is superb climbing. Also, very comfortable on a long ride. My first outing was 5 hours long and it just felt great the whole time. Love the way it holds on downhill corners and it just feels right. It's a bike that definitely gives you confidence. Not sure about the new Dura Ace though. I guess it takes time to get used to the towers. I miss my Campy record stuff.

Strength:
The bike is stiff. From the frame to the crank, the stiffness of the bike allows the immediate transfer of power, ensuring you don't waste any energy. For the price, the bike is well spec'd out. Even the Bontrager X Lite wheels are nice.


Weakness:
The lack of color choice is a bit annoying. Also, Trek plasters its name all over the frame.


I just picked up my Madone 5.9 and took it for an inagural ride. I must say that riding this bike is like driving a Ferrari. Not only does it look fast, it is fast. Coming from a steel frame, this bike is so responsive that I have to adjust my riding style. I no longer see my bottom bracket swaying back and forth when I jump on the pedals. The bike absorbs the bumps in the road, making the ride more enjoyable. Overall, I can't find one thing wrong with this bike. I shopped around all winter, trying to figure out what I wanted. I looked at the Colnago C-40, Pinarello Prince SL, Look, and Specialized. At the end of the day, the price and total package of the Madone was a better buy.

My old ride was a 10 yr. old Specialized Allez Pro steel frame with aluminum fork. The bike was built up with a mix of components from Shimano to Campy. It really can't compare to the Madone, but it served me well.

Weakness:
Very poor finish quality for a $5k bike. Paint has a lot of dirt under the clear. Rough edges around the headset cups. Ding in the headtube and the paint on the fork legs at the axle mount has flaked off in big chunks.


I waited 3 months for this bike and it was well worth it. It is everything I have ever wanted in a ride. It climbs and accelerates well, corners like a razor and is stiff as hell. Paint and finish quality are really poor, however the TREK customer service is AWESOME and they are repaingint the bike for me. I guess I will be without it for another month or so!

Strength:
Light, positivy stiff in a non cannondale 3.0 way. Very beautiful and modern looking, floates over the road and has a feel unlike anything else. Alot of people i find in the cycling world are really opinionated I dont like those types of people and always let people know (for me) what my feelings are, but in my 19 years of riding for me personally I have found that trek had really got it nailed down well. The new dura ace 10 is superb, I had my dura ace 9 group for 4 years so it was time to upgrade anyway.


Weakness:
I guess i would say the price. BUt i am very much of the school that you get what you pay for. I guess if i had waited a while i could have gotten a madone cheaper than i did but my shop did alot of extra things for me too. I honestly cant find any weakness with it yet. It is eveything my trek 5200 was and more. ALso being its a hot bike expect to wait in line for one like i did and alot of other people have. But i would recommend that you get your shop to push them for a date and hold them to it, not because trek is a bad company that way but because if your not on top of things and keep in touch you will miss out, also putting down or paying off the bike to will help you because trek has 2 differnt list and sold bikes are first priority.


Before i start let me recommend bike authroity in broadview heights ohio out side cleveland, the owner is a super guy and really bent over backwards for me. In 2000 i got a trek 5200 in postal colors. I rode that bike and i was totally amazed that a production american carbon bike could feel so amazing. It was light, stiff in a positive way, responsive, in 15 years of riding up to that point i had never had such a great bike. Being the 5900 was the best bike in treks road line up, when i found out about the madone I was really excited. It wasnt because of the lance craze with them, I thought its a natural prgression up from a 5200. Well i was right, this bike is utterly amazing, The shop and i went through hell getting it but oh my it was so worth it. Its everything the 5200 was and more. I have ridden some bikes in the past that were scary light and yet they didnt feel stable some how or substantial. In this case the madone is great. I have put on a bit of weight since moving to ohio, so i tend to have bikes built up sturdier now, but i couldnt be happier, its absolutly beautiful. Mine doesnt have a USPS decal on it but thats fine with me. I really recommend it, It floats on the road, I really feel like in my riding since 1985, ive had probably 15 bikes in that time, i raced a while to that trek is really on target with a fantastic machine, the new dura ace 10 is great to. I wanted to say that it has allot of little updates. It fits in your hands better with wht sti levers. I I am so used to it now where 9speed shifters just feel cramped compared when i feel them now. There is no chian rub of anykind (even when dura ace 9 was adjusted perfectly in a sprint it rubbed slightly). The shifting is crisp and positive and quiet. I am also using the DEDA synapsi carbon bars which (i know) are not legal for racing but oh god the carbon bar and stem set up on a carbon bike just further enhaces the feel, not to mention a Look ergo post which is carbon with 3 times the adjustment of a typical post. THe new shimano road pedals are like a TIME/LOOK hybrid. THe front part of the cleat is like time and the back part is like look, i think they blow away the SPD-r pedals. And to finish it off the selle italia pro-link saddle is the shape of the old regal saddle but is so much nicer, It is not the lightest to be sure but I have finally found a saddle that doesnt hurt and it really is about anatomy, the more you have in the backside *cough* the wider it should be and more padding I think they are great, I personally think its pretty silly to look for weight savings in aeres where comfort comes first AKA aspide saddles??? ouch.

Yes the 5900 was a bit lighter but aside from that to me personally they felt more or less the same, if i compare the 5200 with the madone its a big big differnce, I dont mind being in debt when its worth it and trust me the madone is, pushing a pretty big gear on the flats is like floating the bike just is great. Yeah lance rides it and yeah lance is getting paid to ride them but i have ridden colnago c-40s and a few other bikes and for me personally the trek is alot better, I learned with trek that you dont have to have something super exotic and rare to have a great bike , if you look at the exotics now they are follwing trends insted of creating them. ANd with exotics when something happens with them you are screwed or the turn around time is months, not so with trek. There are other good brands out there sure but i sing treks prasis because they earned respect from me, the madone is a total joy to ride.

Stunning. The crisp, and efficient power transfer, and nimble & stable steering is expected. What is surprising is the quality of the ride. After owning a 5200 for a year, this truly surpasses the ride quality of the previous tubesets. Combined with the distinct look and aerodynamics this is a major progression.

Excellent bike. I had a Giant TCR Composite, Colango Dream Plus, Gitane Alumimum, Cannondale Aluminum, Specialized Composite. All of them cannot beat the performance I experience on this new Trek 5900 Super Light. Response excellent during hard climb, accelerates great, great performance on the flat, all these great performance beats the other bikes I used to have. If you can use high RPM to propell uphill, you must try this bike, compare to Giant, it is mush more responsive and fell better than the others. May be the geometry, construction method and material make the difference.

It is hard to wipe the silly grin off my face after a ride. It is an awesome bike. Maybe someday I will be as good as this bike. This is my first carbon bike and I am amazed how it climbs and accelerates. My old bike is a steel frame,which is very comfortable but there is no comparison in capability with the 5900. I had heard that carbon has a very dead feel, but I have not found that to be the case. This bike is very responsive and comfortable to ride. This is my first experience with Shimano components and I must say after getting used to them, the Dura Ace 10spd is great. This frame is a Project One with custom paint and I would say the finish is an eight out of ten. I highly recommend this bike.

My only complaint, not really much of one, is that the frame held a lot of water when I rode it in the rain once. I have no idea how that much water got in the frame but sure does not drain out.


I totally love this bike. I ordered it from Trek with the Project One flame paint job; looks awesome. It took a little while to get in but it was worth the wait. 
I'm 5'6"", 150lbs. I love to power my way up hills and the 5900 is a perfect bike for doing so, stiff and light. This is my first carbon bike and was a little reluctant about purchasing a carbon bike but I am very impressed, the frame is forgiving yet very responsive. With the new Dura-Ace the 5900 has got to be one of the smoothest bikes I have every ridden. Way to go Trek on building a great bike and ""WAY TO GO LANCE, #6!""

Strength:
Light light light. Handles like a dream. Smooth, mellow ride saves the back and legs.

New 10x DA is great. 

Barrel adjusters are great for on-the-fly trimming.

Bontrager bits and pieces are inappropriately maligned. It's good stuff.


Weakness:
I would say the price, but I got a great deal, so that doesn't apply to me. $4800 would be pretty steep. I consider $3500 a bargain. Worth every penny. Still, that's a lot of pennies.


As others have pointed out, the finish is not what it probably could be. 

The stock saddle is a cruel joke.

The bike leaves little room for my wife in bed.


Where to start..

How about with ""I love my bike""? 

It is, admittedly, about ten steps above my previous ride, so I'm comparing apples to oranges. That said, the 5900 is heaven on earth. I've done about 7000 feet of hills in my first week with the bike and everything they say is true. It loves to climb. The surprising thing to me is that it's not just the weight difference - everything just feels . . . better. 

Some folks have compared it negatively to the Giant and Orca because of its ""cushy"" ride. I consider that to be an asset, when you're talking about 100+ mile rides. It doesn't feel as jumpy as they do, but the responsiveness is still there. 

Next most surprising thing was how well it descends. The handling inspires confidence and provides excellent feedback from the road. Very simple, sure-footed ride.

The rational side of my brain tells me that the bike can't make me faster on the flats. But my gut explains that the increased comfort and general excellence of the bike actually allows me to kick more ass by some inexplicable mechanism.

Why did I wait so long to get a really good bike?

Strength:
It does just about everything well. Got the frame new in the box, then sent it back to Trek remove the postal crap, and repaint in solid color Metal Flake Yellow, then built it up, with Record carbon. I have never cared for the Shimano stuff, and the Campy is about 600 grams lighter.


Weakness:
The repainted frame was ok, nothing great, a few bubbles, over spray on the headset.


At 6’4” 220 lbs, it’s hard to find a bike that will not flex much under heavy sprints at my weight. Very sweet bike...

Strength:
Great bang for your big bucks. Life time warrenty. Quality carbon frame, VERY light! Project 1 personalization option.
Great for climbing. Fast acceleration.
Frame=Stable, with a unique dampening stiffness. A very sturdy fork.


Weakness:
The Cane Creek Headset that comes with it has always had a complaint here and there (creaking, stearing seems tight). If you buy a 5900, do yourself a favor and go the extra ~$130 more for a Chris King headset because you'll never regret it.


I work as a full time mechanic at the local bike shop in my town and love my Trek 5900 Superlight. From the day I pulled it out of the box and assembled it, its flawless Dura Ace componentry and light OCLV 110 carbon frame has spoiled me. This job has provided me the insight to view the spending habits of an array of customers that buy other expensive bikes such as Serotta Ottrotts (hand made), Bianchi San Lorenzo X2s, Merlins and/or custom Merlins and custom bikes for that matter; and I've always felt the reason why people upgrade to these bicycles is to get the lightest, best working component technology available. This is true, but they don't realize that the 5900 IS the lightest road bike available with a heritage of 4 Tour de France victories and an unbeatable life time warrenty. Of course this shows that Trek carefully constructed the 5900 to help Lance to his victories in the Tour, but I look at it as the best bang for your buck expensive road bike.

Weakness:
Hard to decide what color to get if you go P1.


This is the best bike I have ever ridden! I am lucky that the trek bikes fit me really well. The 5900 is a lot faster then the 5200 that I was use to. I love the new 10 speed and x-lite wheels. It seems to retain the ride quality of the 5200 but gives better power transfer. I tried the 5.9 but it was too stiff for me and my 5900 with speedplay pedals weighs in at 15.7 pounds!!!

A very firm ride for strong riders/racers. Provides a combination of road damping on rough roads and firm acceleration on steep climbs.

Strength:
Great frame for a first road bike. Very responsive yet absorbs the bumps in the road very well. Feels ""racy"" without being uncomfortable. Not that I particularly care what it looks like, but the black matte finish is pretty darn cool and is a nice change of pace from all of the high gloss finishes out there.


Weakness:
Seat is narrow and would likely only be comfortable for people with fairly narrow sit bones. If your sit bones are wider apart, go with a wider saddle and you won't be disappointed. Wheelset is OK, but upgrading to a lighter, more aero and stiffer wheelset takes this bike to a whole new level.  The designers were apparently very ""sticker happy"" when they designed it. I don't think they could squeeze another ""Trek"" sticker on it if they tried. But whatever - I ride it and love it just the way it is.


I am a long-time mountain biker who has gained a few pounds over the years and jumped into road cycling this summer to get back into shape. I live in the hill country of central Texas and the Madone 4.5 (with Shimano 105) is great for climbing and descending, even on rough roads. I feel like the effort I put into cranking or spinning is greatly rewarded. On flats, it feels very responsive when I push on the gas to sprint and it almost wants to jump out from under me. (Love that feeling!) I often find myself smiling unintentionally like a kid - especially on the downhills. The downhills feel seure and solid at 35+ mph. I don't give a second thought to leaning into the corners. I've heard that the brakes are not as great as the rest of the components, but they stop securely and work well enough for me. I read somewhere that you can replace the brake pads with Shimano Dura-Ace pads pretty inexpensively but I have not felt the need to do this yet.  Like others, I quickly upgraded the seat to a Specialized Phenom and it is now nearly as comfortable as a favorite chair. Can ride all day without issues.  The DuoTrap (ANT+) sensor embedded in the frame is nice and slick and even though it's not the least expensive option, I highly recommend it. I paired it with a Node 1 computer and have been pleased. The Bontrager SSR wheels were great to get started with, felt solid and handled well and were fairly responsive to sprinting and climbimg. But an upgrade to a set of ROL Race SL's (1520 grams) made this great bike even better. Sprinting and climbing improved to a whole new level. I also have to mention that the customer service at ROL is awesome by any measure. I would highly recommend the Madone 4.5 to anyone looking for a racy, yet budget-conscious, entry level carbon bike. Use the money you save to upgrade to a set of ROL wheels and you won't be disappointed.

Strength:
Fast and smooth ride that handles various road conditions, effortless to ride (especially with wheel upgrade)and especially uphill. Flat black is a nice look that gets plenty of compliments.


Weakness:
Stock Wheelset and Saddle. The Bontrager SSR wheels were stout but I found them to be heavy (approx. 2000 grams) and didn't spin up very well. Also agree with others that the bike is a little logo happy; although, most bike companies are these days. The Affinity saddle was too harsh and caused numbness.


I have owned my Trek Madone 4.5 for about 3 months now and I am very pleased with my decision to buy this bike. The Madone is fast, smooth, and handles all kinds of road conditions. I ride near my home and there are a lot of hills but the Madone attacks and pulls with a stiff well connected ride. As a turn-key bike it is well equipped, although, I have made several upgrades. Most were minor (seat and stem) but the decision to upgrade the wheels (Mavic Equipe) has made the ride even that much better. The stock Bontrager SSR wheels are just okay but the bike really benefited from the addition of the Equipe's (improved weight and bearings). One of the coolest things about this bike is the Duo-Trap that accommodates a speed/cadence sensor to be embedded into the frame which gives it a clean trick look.  Aesthetically the bike is quite striking, receiving many compliments but is a bit logo happy. I like the white of the 2012 a little more but not enough to pay out the additional money. Overall, I would recommend this bike because of it's overall ride quality, components, and good looks.

Strength:
Fast ride, handles road irregularities and bumps well, effortless to ride, climbs well, handles curves expertly, absolute beauty to look at.


Weakness:
Haven't found any yet. Minor detail but I could have done with a few less or Trek logos. Too many on this bike.


With the new 2012 line ready for market, I got a great deal on the 2011 model. The new paint scheme is super-cool but I figured the 2011 wasn't so bad either. I wanted to wait until I put over 100 miles on the bike before I wrote a review. Didn't have to wait too long in spite of my demanding day job. Took me just over a week. I never feel like stopping when I start riding this bike. Very responsive, power transfer you can feel, extremely smooth shifting and an ace at climbing, although I haven't done a lot of the latter. I was a bit wobbly over the first couple of rides but that was due to my ineptitude as a rider on his first road bike. It compensates very well for my lack of riding strength by converting even light efforts into surprising speed and agility.  Very comfortable to take on long rides although primarily built to be a stiff racer. Mine weighs about 18.5 lbs with a pair of Look Keo Classic pedals. Took me all of 5 minutes to get the bike fit to me (although that may vary from person to person) and I have not faced any challenges even on long rides. The most common (and only) complaint I heard about it in all the reviews I read was that the saddle was uncomfortable. Maybe its just me but saddles are meant to be uncomfortable and you get used to them over time - I had no major discomfort or pain on a 4.5 hour long ride I did last week. The Shimano 105 groupo is only a few grams heavier than the Ultegra - something most riders won't notice and the shifting and braking are super-smooth. This bike is worth every penny you'll spend on it and more. It is fast, comfortable, effortless, visually stunning and most importantly, provides very gratifying riding experiences. Thank you, Trek for the Madone 4.5!

Recently purchased my new Madone 4.5 and after putting 60 miles on it I couldnt be any happier. It climbs real well and I have noticed how quiet the ride is compared to most other cyclist I go by on the road. The LBS could have tightened up some of the adjustments before leaving the shop. I did test ride at least 4 other bikes including the Cannondale, Specialized Roubaix and Cervelo but the Madone was far smoothies and quicker. Only one complaint would have been the Bontrager saddle, that was replaced within 20 miles. I read complaints on brakes but I have no issues with them.

Strength:
comfortablepackage works well together


Weakness:
Tiagra brakes inadequate - SSR wheels are heavy - seat very uncomfortable


This is my first bicycle purchase in over 35 years. Bike technology has sure changed over that time span. The Madone 4.5 is a sweet bike. The Madone 4 series are manufactured in Taiwan, higher level Madones are still made in Wisconsin. To keep at a price point, every model year has ""cheaper"" components on them. The 2010 model year has a mix of 105, Tiagra, and no-name Shimano components. Almost every review dissed the seat. Yup, after actually trying it out, I can confirm that is is wasted manufacturing resources. It was gone after about 1/2 of a mile. Another complaint is the weakness of the Tiagra brakes. On-line vendors have decent prices on Ultegra brakes and I swapped out the Tiagra brakes next. Slowly, over the past year, I've been swapping out all the 105 components to the point where now only the shifters are 105, the rest of the bike is Ultegra. I purchased my bike with the triple crankset. Glad I did for use in the hills around my area. Frame geometry is Trek's ""H2"" geometry, which is their comfort configuration, (as opposed to race configuration). I had to shorten the stem by 10mm to give me a comfortable fit. Love the traditional shape of the handlebars. Have heard complaints about the wheels also. They are fine, but I did swap them out for lighter wheels that I took from another bike after I upgraded the wheels on that one. The wheels are heavy, but robust. Rode a century the other week, and had no issues on the ride. This bike will last a long time.

I looked at similar bikes from Cannondale, Specialized, and Giant and had almost gone wih another selection. I've fancied a Madone for a while, but didn't know that they had a selection in my price range until stopping by my local LBS. Aside from the handlebars (I switched from the stock 42 cm to 44s), everything is stock. Despite other reviews, the saddle works just fine for me. The ""no name"" brakes work well, too (I push the brakes levers and the brakes stop the bike. What more should I want???) Furthermore, I LOVE the matte black color!

The 2010 Madone 4.5 is the stiffest most forgiving bike that I have ever had the pleasure to ride. I started my rides with a few 20-30 mile hill climbs in the Reno Tahoe Area. I was soon comfortable enough to climb geiger grade,a 14 mile hill climb. I immediately decided that it was time to put myself and the bike to the test. After gaining some input from a bike coach i was off and peddling. I completed the 75 mile ride around Lake Tahoe in just over 4.5 hours and still felt like there was more left in me. This bike handles like a dream in the climbs and in the 40mph descents from the large hills.

I was a former spin junkie doing 5+ classes a week. Bought a Gary Fisher hardtail thinking I would do trips on a local trail. Got bored with that and started riding on the street for 30+ miles. Went on a Backroads trip in Sonoma (best vacation ever, by the way) and knew I had to get a real road bike. I have heard that you should get the most bike you can afford and thought entry level carbon would be the ticket. LBS recommended the Madone as the best all around bike from their selection...and I think they hit it dead on. The carbon soaks up the road *far* better than I expected. The frame is plenty stiff to put all of my 6'0"" 165lb power to the ground. It's amazing how you get into a groove and just keep cranking out the smooth strokes. I end up burning more calories without even knowing it. I have quickly built up to 200 miles a week and love every mile. Except for the rock hard seat...it has to go. The stock brakes were ok, but went to Ultegra anyway. I have some hills where I hit 43+ mph and want to make sure I can stop. If I had to change anything else it would be the handlebars. I think a carbon unit would soak up even more vibrations and I can get it to flex a little when I pull hard on a hill.

Strength:
Frame is light and stiff. Smooth ride on the Bontrager wheels.


Weakness:
Brakes and handlebars. They had to skimp somewhere to keep the cost down and make it affordable.


I always fancied a Trek Madone, but they were always a little out of reach regards price. This model offers superb value for money and is a first class ride, although a couple of items are worth getting changed for better quality. I changed the brakes, which were un branded, to Ultegra and the Stem to a Bontrager xxx Lite. I have riden just over 500 trouble free miles on the bike, it is responsive, quick to accelerate and is a joy to ride. I am very pleased.

Bought the bike in 2008. Purchased the 62 cm 2008 performance model. Good bike for an entry level carbon. Bike is stiff, semi-light with average components. Bike handles good and responsive. The brakes and cables are generic. Upgraded the brakes to Ulterga's and cables to Dura-Ace--better stopping power. The handle bars are cheap Bontrager's that don't absorb shock well. Wheelsets are bontrager's race os, at 2000 miles I busted the rear spoke. Not a bad bike for the price and entry level rider.

Bought the 4.5 performance Madone 62cm frame in 2008. It is a 2008 model. Was my first road bike and love it. Had to adjust the stem--longer legs then reach. Wasn't happy with the brakes. Upgraded the brakes and brake cables to Ulterga's (brakes) and Dura-ace cables. Better stopping power. The frame is great--stiff, semi-light and supports heavier riders. Busted a spoke from the factor Bontager Race OS rear wheel. No major issues. Great bike for the price--welcome to the Trek family. If you are more aggressive try the pro series. If I would do it again, I would have purchased the 5.5 pro series or even the performance.

Ok guys and gals, I simply could not help myself to make this post so soon because the bike is AMAZING!! I just traded up at my LBS from the entry level Trek 1.2 yesterday and WOW!! I road for an hour that evening, dreamt about the ride last night and just completed a short ride again and had not beeen for the weather would still be out there right now. This bike is silky smoothe, handles like a dream (loves cornering) and is fast, from the jump to the all out flat road where it make you feel like shouting Yippie!!!! I just completed my first mini-duathlon on Sunday last in 56 minute and had had this bike then I am sure would have shaved off at least another six minutes. FREE advice: Get out there and trade up NOW!!! You can thank me later.....Never riden a Tour De France bike, but this I am sure is as close as you can get at a fraction of the cost...

Recently put a deposit down on 2009 Trek Madone 4.5 should be able to pick up the bike on 2-16-09. Currently have a Bianchi Campione, vintage about 1998 and a 2008 Trek FX 7.3 Can't wait to get my hands on the 4.5 and take it thru the peaks and valleys of Northern N.J. Opted for the triple but don't know why. Occasionally climb long, steep grades and thought of the triple as added insurance. I'll be able to add more later as I mount this new, carbon frame, blue beauty and enjoy biking the way it was meant to be.

Strength:
Great allround package. Smooth, quick and comfortable.


Weakness:
Brakes work well enough but would have been nice to have the 105's to round off the package.


mine is actually the 08 model and my LBS had them disounted (purchased in AUD)as 09 stock was coming. At normal RRP it may not be considered best value around. Having looked around at virtually every alternative i went with advice from my LBS that this bike was the goods even though it was entry level madone, it oozes quality that you would expect from trek. The non spec'd brakes let down what is a great package. I was immediately quicker on this bike than my previous with less effort. It's smooth, handles well and is comfortable. I had to play around with bars and stems to get the right reach (longer legs than reach). It's not exactly a light weight (nor is it considered heavy.....8.5kg with pedlas) but then again the bikes ability is better than mine will ever be. At the price RRP not sure if it would be the best value bike around, but having said that........it's still a great bike and a great ride. It's got treks great liabilty and life time waranty.

Was looking for a bike to save some wear and tear on my custom steel and did not want to pay a ton of money. That is when I came across this beauty, on sale no less. I am very surprised at how this bike rides. It is smooth and stiff but also comfortable at the same time. 105 group rivals that of Ultergra in quality and performance. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a carbon bike but not wanting to spend a ton of cash.

Strength:
Refinement of the ride.


Weakness:
I wish Trek would include pedals on their higher-end models.


Nimble. Comfortable. Stable. All the resources that Trek has at their disposal for R&D is really felt with the Madone 4.5. They have taken the best of Greg LeMond and his inputs, as well as Lance Armstrong's years of fine tuning. Can you ask for two better developers? Add on top of that Trek's fantastic reputation and solid company profile, and you have a winning product. No other company has the resources that Trek does, and it shines through with the Madone series. The 4.5, although the least expensive of the Madone series, is LEAPS AND BOUNDS a better ride than other bikes in this price point. I test rode several $2000 rigs from several companies, and none had the refinement of the 4.5. I'm a seasoned cyclist and mechanic and really appreciate the craftsmanship of the 4.5. Good parts spec, nice and light for my standards. I am a club rider, so a 1-2 pound difference to me is no big deal. Great!

Replaced tires and tubes and off to ride!Rides well on the 28s although I have considered 25 or 23; however just posted some PRs with it , and am thinking, leave it alone. It feels solid when riding, and once up to usual riding speed (17-19mph) it feels fine.If you find one like this, in this condition, lucky you!!I use ot for my backup when the Domane is in the shop--nice to have a solid backup.

Strength:
ultegra componets, adustable stem, suspension seat with carbon forks, crankset 52/42/30, mitchelin carbon tires, alpha/alum. frame for stiffness,


Weakness:
brake pads replaced with durace pads, I gave up a little comfort by replacing the orginal 700x28 for the mitchelin 700x23 carbon to pick up speed.


After riding 16 months, 4,000 miles and a century on the trek 1800c comfort road bike I can say you get alot more bike than what the $1300.00 pays for. 
Riding in the century I found myself riding with a fairly fast pace group of riders riding litespeed, klien pro, 5000 trek, specialized roubaix pro and eddy merckx bicycles. The 1800c held its own riding with bikes costing 3 to 4 times its cost. It shifted flawlessly thanks to the ultegra compontets. The Bontrager race wheels have been great in the 4,000 miles I have road them. ( I would buy bontrager in a heart beat) The adjustable stem raises and lowers the handlebars accourding to your fitness. You can raise the handlebars for recreational riding or lower it for more speed. The suspension seatpost and the carbon fork combine for a smooth ride. The alpha/alum. frame makes it stiff enough that in the climbs it can stay with the highend bikes. It also has a triple ultegra crankset that's there if you need it. Are the highend bikes better than the 1800c? Certainly, but the 1800c is good enough bike that if your engine is tuned you can ride with just about anyone. If you are in need of a bike that you can get in shape with and one that will grow with you as a cyclist the 1800c is your ride.

Strength:
I wanted something that would be comfortable, so for me the strengths would be the suspension seatpost and the soft and cushy saddle they use. I just got back into riding and I've already been able to ride for 4 hours on this bike and not feel it in my, ummm, rump. ;-)


Weakness:
I'm sure I'll find some, but having just started riding again I just like the bike and haven't really found anything I dislike about it.


I purchased this bike because of the Ultegra package it contains at a significantly lower price than other bikes with the same package. I'm new to riding again after a very long absence and I hold no dreams of competing, just riding for fun, exercise, and maybe an occasional century ride at a pace my 43 year old body can handle. I'm a bit heavy, so I like the carbon fork as well as the suspension seatpost for absorbing shock. Sure, the bike is a bit heavier than the sleek/fast 2100/2300's from Trek, but I think it rides more comfortably and works well for me. It is WAY better than the Trek 7200 hybrid I ride with friends and my kids. I have to say, the Ultegra package is everything I expected - just phenomenal shifting. This is a great ride for anyone that wants a road bike, but also wants to be at least somewhat comfortable.

Weakness:

I have read every review in this site prior to buying this bike. I must concure with reviews and say this thing is great. I took it out for a good test with another rider who is faster than I and would usually drop me if there was any wind or hills. I was able to stay with him on both today. This bike handles so great, it is light, fast and I can't believe how well it fits me. I am 6'00"" and weigh 175. I don't get tired riding this bike. I would recomend one of these for anyone looking to upgrade and possibly enter the racing arena. I upgraded from my previous bike, a Trek 1000 because I have ambitions of racing in the future. Talking with my friend, he said he could already see this bike is helping me. I still consider myself new to cycling, but this bike is great! If you don't have one Get One! They are worth it.

Weakness:
The Bontrager parts are heavier than some others out there and the saddle hurts


I got this bike over the winter and since then have logged about 1000 miles on it. I really like this bike, especially the frame. I've replaced the saddle, the stem, the handlebars, the crank, and the wheels. The only reason I replaced the crank is that in 2007 Trek didn't offer any compact cranks and since I love climbing big passes I need the range. This frame fits wonderfully, handles smoothly and does not fatigue the rider even when in the saddle all day. If you want a world-class bike without spending an arm and leg this is a bike for you

Strength:
Lightweight. stiff. fast. the ""Lance"" frame but with different components. A lot of fun. Great racer but comfortable enough to ride all day long.


Weakness:
stock wheelset. The handlebars and stem aren't bad, but they aren't the best.


When shopping for bikes, I looked over at least 15 different bikes in the price range of $2000-$3000. We were shocked to see this bike for $2000. Every where else it was $2699 or more. When it came to the Madone I was hesitant because I had heard things like it wasn't stiff, and it had a ""dead"" feel. But after test riding the Tarmac Expert, Six 13, Fastback LTD, Opal, and many others this was the one for me. It was very stiff and quick and the ""Dead"" feel is something I don't think is true. Vibration is greatly dampened and it allows you to hold your line far better than a jittery bike like my old Felt F80. Full Ultegra is great but I will upgrade to D/A or Sram Force if/when I become a Cat. 3. I weighed the bike stock (plus two carbon bottle cages) and it weighed .5 lbs more than advertised. It weighed 18.1 when they said it was 17.6 . I bought Ksyrium SL's and the bike is now very light and cornering is great. The stock wheels are not so hot. They feel heavy and slow. I spend 30-60 mins/week making tiny adjustments on the cables and brakes making sure every thing is perfect. True with all carbon fiber, the smallest thing will scratch the frame. One reviewer said that the seatpost was bad. I haven't had any problems and I also think it looks really cool. I am 6' 0"" and 150lb. Most seatposts can hold the weight of their rider (unless you are very overweight or just freakishly tall. Most cyclists are not). 500 miles after buying this bike I love it and only wish I had the Madone 5.9 SSL ($10,000). If only i was loaded. I am saving up to get a pair of Zipp's or Bontrager xxx lite aero's. That would make this bike as close to perfect as possible.

Strength:
- full carbon frame- stiff- fast- great bike for the price


Weakness:
- come with a basic saddle- seat post design


I got this bike after my 2005 Pilot 5.2 frame was broken while it is under warranty. The exchange was no problem since it was a defect. Trek even allow me to upgrade to Madone 5.2 SL frame. I have put over 2000 miles on this since June 06. It is much more fun to ride this then my old Pilot. It's fast, light, stiff and very stable when you ride fast. However, it wasn't as comfortable to do long ride until I put in some upgrade. I change out the seat post, handle bar, stem, saddle. Since then, it is perfect. I feel like I can ride it all day. One thing that I hate is the seat post, no matter how tie I put it, it seems to move my saddle. And I finally broken it. The one bolt design on the side can't seem to keep the saddle in the position. It is the only thing I don't like about this bike. I am giving 4 for value because I have to upgrade a few things, and my seat post broke. Otherwise, it is a really great bike.

Strength:
- all carbon-fibre frame- frame geometry- Trek is a great USA company- Shimano Ultegra is good enough for most non-competitive cyclists- Lance Armstrong proved this bike is great and therefore good enough for me !


Weakness:
- comes with a crappy saddle, I believe they have done this as each rider has their own preference, so you will have to buy a new saddle.


I have belonged to a cycling club since 1992, when I bought a steel-chromoly Bianchi. I retired that bike and bought the Trek Madone 5.3 SL with 110 carbon, with Ultegra groupos. I have nothing but good things to say about this bike. I did plenty of research and felt this was the best bike available for that price range. Lance Armstrong proved this bike can win the Tour de France, so it is good enough for me and my cycling club for 200km a week. I recommend this bike highly.

Weakness:
from riding a much cheaper road bike for the last year, i think it is unlikely that i will ever find a weakness.a bike for life?


i only bought the bike this week and today was my first ride on it. all i can say is ""wow."" prior to deciding to buy the madone i read reviews on this site, and others, to help me make my decision. anyway, back to my first ride today. the acceleration on this bike is unbelievable (i have spent the last year riding a dawes giro 400, which is a road bike, and not a race bike). the handling of the madone is very stable, and the buzzkill inserts really do absorb road vibration. more than i would have imagined. this bike is more aimed at serious road racers, but i feel that if anyone wants a really lightweight road bike should really consider this bike. i did, and have already fallen in lve with it. i have yet to climb any serious hills on this machine, but i am looking forward to that. i will post another review in a couple of months to give a more objective description (although, i think that it is unlikely to change).

What accelerates like a racecar, climbs like a rocket, and is the most durable bike out there? The Madone 5.2 SL!!! I cannot say enough about this bike! It has Ultegra/Dura-Ace parts so it shifts smoothly, brakes well and is reliable and durable. If you are considering the 5.2 SL...buy it. I guarantee it will be the fastest, nicest bike you have ever ridden. I'm a sprinter and I cannot feel ANY flex on the frame when I accelerate, feel no wobble on the downhills, and have no problem setting personal time to climb records on this bike.

Strength:
The frame is amazing: Light, Stiff, Comfortable. The ultegra 10-speed components are really nice too.


Weakness:
The Bontrager components leave a lot to be desired (when compared to the rest of the bike) I am particularly un-impressed with the wheels.


Overall, this is an incredible bike. If Trek would stop using their bontrager components on their higher end bikes, this could potentially be the perfect bike for an amateur racer who doesn't want to break the bank on a custom built frame.

Strength:
Weight, stiffness, and vertical compliance. Quite possibly the world's perfect bike. Paint job gets compliments by everyone who sees it.


Weakness:
I'm not a big fan of the head tube- no finish to it whatsoever. An integrated headset would really set the bike off nicely. Upgrade to SL from ""regular"" Madone 5.2 is pricey- I just hated the shark fin. Stock Bontrager Race X Lite components and Race Lite wheels WAY underspec'd for the price


I work in a bike shop, so I pretty much had my pick of bikes. I had been drooling over this bike for a long time, and it's lived up to my every expectation. As it sits, the bike is 16.4 pounds, including pedals, cages, and computer. The frame climbs and accelerates better than anything I've ever been on, but is silky smooth when the road gets rough. Stiff AND smooth?! Favorite... bike... ever.

Strength:
The frame is smooth and light very comfortable the ultrega drivetrain is first rate all the way through.


Weakness:
The stock wheels tires seat seatpost bar and stem are disappointing....I'm switching them out as i go along.


I bought this bike last year after my previous bike was stolen. I had built up a 2000 USPS TREK OCLV 120 with Mavic (black ) Kysyrium Wheels Look pedals Dura Ace 9speed etc. Light and fast and beautiful....loved the paint on it. I rode it for 5 years and then it was gone. Insurance gave me about half whet it was valued so i got the Madone SL 5.2. I wasn't thrilled but it was familiar. As I've ridden it it's really grown on me. I love the new outside bearing bottom brackets stiff and smooth. The Ultegra shifts great the brakes work extremely well and the frame soaks up the road shocks. It's not a rocket like a Cannondale SIX13 but hey I'm 57 6'1"" 170lbs. I hated the stock wheels and I really think the ride and feel have improved since I changed them out the tires as well. I use Vittoria Open Corsa CX but I'm thinking of switching to Contys. All in all now that I've gotten over the pain of losing my previous ride I'm liking this one more and more. I'd recommend it to anyone who is into longer faster rides

Strength:
Light as a featherSmooth as butterFast as SupermanGood paint job7 Time Tour Champion pedigreeLooks cool!


Weakness:
A little slower on the sprints, but I don't think it would cost anyone a race.


I bought a '06 a few months ago and I have put well over 1,000 miles on it. I'm primarily a mountain biker and I train quite a bit on my road bike for my mtn bike races. This bike is light, fast, and smooth. My average speed automatically increased by 1-2 mph's on this bike. It soaks up road vibration great and seems to glide along the road as if it's almost floating. That's not to say the road feel is diminished. You still feel everything, it's just softer. Acceleration isn't quite as quick as my all aluminum, stiff-as-a-board cannondale, but most bikes aren't. C-dales are known for their stiffness. Overall, I'm very pleased with this bike. My first impression was ""I can ride this all day long."" The C-dale fatigues your body from all the constant vibration.

Strength:
Lots of good componets such as the OCLV 110 carbon frame, the Triple X lite forks and the Ultegra set. (The newer 2006 model year has Race X Lite forks.)  Good price. And I do like the seat...


Weakness:
The use of carbon steel bearings in the head set (I believe this was fixed in 2006 model) The use of Chrome plated carbon steel bolts in several places.  The long stroke length needed to shift the front derailleur.


The bike is a great buy. It's a poor man's $8,000 Madone 5.9 SSL. It's basically the same frame 110 OLCV Vs. 55 OLCV, Race Lite wheels vs. exotic carbons, one notch lower gear set and several components such as the bars, seat and head set are quite a bit less impressive.  I have owned this bike for 1 year and 4,000 miles. It replaces a Terk 1500. I'm a 57 yr. old with 2 years of biking. I weigh about 190 lbs. The stem extender was needed to make these old bones comfortable.  The bike has worked well over the year. I have riden in rain and shine mostly flat terrain.  I've gone through 2 sets of Bontrager Race X Lite tires (Fast wearing, about 1200 mile life.) and halfway through a set of Vittoria Open Corsa EVO CX.(They cut way too easily) Now I have a set of Contential GP 40000's which show no cuts and acceptable wear over 1000 miles. The Dura Ace Chain replaced Ultegra at 2,000 miles. The Dura Ace chain shows practically no wear at 4,000 miles.  The Head set was replced with the Chris King after I noticed some binding. The original head set was carbon steel and was throughly rusted. I do wash the bike about once a week and that probably didn't help. But for $3K another $10 bucks would have had a stainless steel set of the same brand. The mechanics work well, Shifting is percise with single stepping going up in ratio and mutiple stepping going down. In other words you can down shift several gears at once dependong on how far you push the lever.  Over all this is a good bike for a serious rier who wants a tour proven design but a bargain price, You can add the nicer stuff over time if you desire or use it as is.

Strength:
Ultegra 10 speed superior to 9 speed systems in comfort and shiftingSmooth ride qualityFast feelLight and StiffOCLV 110 *MADE IN AMERICA*


First, I've owned this bike for a little over a month now and have ridden this bike for over 500 miles. Having come from a 2004 Trek 2100, I was surprised at the difference in ride quality, as the Madone seems to glide over the pavement. It absorbs much of the road vibration while maintaining a low frame weight and stiffness. I find it comfortable enough for long rides while maintaining a race feel that you can lose with some of the more comfortable road bikes. I upgraded the handlebars to FSA K-wings (heavy, but excellent comfort) and had the bike shop install a Chris King headset.  The new Ultegra 10 speed system is top of the line. Shifting is smooth and positive and having more gears allow for a tighter cassette, meaning that you’ll be more likely to a find a gear for any terrain. The hoods are slimmer than that previous Shimano brifters and seem more comfortable to use, although the 9 speed systems were ok as well. I choose a double and am very pleased with that choice, as I almost never used the 30 tooth chainring and the front derailleur was difficult to setup and trim correctly. I find that the double provides a better and more reliable shifting method. Overall, I would highly recommend this bicycle for a racer or fast recreational rider.

This is and addition to the review I just wrote on the 2006 Madone 5.2SL size 62. The weight of 17.8lbs is with bike computer and cromoly Speedplay pedals. I believe the bike weighed about 17.3-17.4lbs as it came from the store which is really good for such a large frame. Since the review have used a Specialized Toupe saddle which I like so far and it has saved about 1/4lb of weight. Bike now has about 550 miles and I'm loving it!

I have the 2006 Madone 5.2 SL. My 62cm size completely stock with cage and bike computer weighs about 17.8lbs. Bike is awesome to ride! I've had it for a little less than 2 months and have nearly 500miles on it so far. Seems to be best of both worlds, really stiff for efficient pedaling but it doesn't feel very harsh over bumps and low amounts of road buzz. I really love this bike. It is expensive but I'm happy that I spent the money it makes cycling fun! (17.8lbs weight is stock bike with computer, cage and speedplay cromoly pedals. I think the bike was around 17.3lbs as it came from the shop.)

Strength:
Stable, fast accelerator, great hill climber, stiff but shock absorbant.


Weakness:
My steel bikes still feel softer in ride quality but that's as far as it goes.


This bike is incredibly steady during high speed downhills, very responsive in quick acceleration power bursts, unbelievably reactive during climbs, very comfortable to ride and more, lots more. The Ultegra 10 is instantaneous and positive, even if slightly heavier than its brother, the Dura Ace (by about 4 ounces). I changed the headset to a Chris King due to the poor rep for the one that came with the bike. I also ride on Specialized All Condition Pro, a tire with a far better rep than the original Bontragers.

Strength:
My 110 OCLV weapon of choice. Easily defeats the harsh evil forces of munimula and that mushy muinatit. This is my mid-life crisis. Goes longer, faster and smoother than I ever could. Shut your computor off NOW and just go buy this bike.


Weakness:
It came too late in my life. I wish this was built 25 years ago when I had lots more energy. Would have been nice to have the raceXlite wheels... Shimano should put the Flightdeck computor as standard issue with the Ultegra group. They should also be required to do the set up on the computor. GM doesn't sell you a radio and then make you install it yourself!!!


This review is for the Madone 5.2 SL. I have been going steady with this bike for less than a month. I think I am in love!! Last Friday, January 27th I rode from Burlington,Ontario to Vineland. This ride normally takes me 2 hours. It was very cold but on the new bike I shaved 10 minutes off my previous best time. Who says money can't buy time?
The ride and handling is incredible. Thanks to Rik at BIKEFIT.ca for all the advice and set-up help. It felt a little twitchy at first, but now we are a dynamic duo. I read some others who complained about the seat but it seems fine to me. I think once you hit 50, like I just did, that it should be manatory that you only ride carbon. It is just too nice...thanks TREK, or should I say thanks to Lance!
 If you are looking to buy this bike SHOP around...for some reason the pricing seems to be all over the map, especially here in Canada. Also, beware of the used stuff on the web, NO frame guarantee if you buy there.

Bontrager bars are uncomfortable when in the drops and saddle is also too padded and the rails where not straight when I got the bike - it will be replaced soon.


Wow, exceeded my expectations. Really light and stiff -- climbs easily, but also descends faster and more confidently than any bike I've ridden. 
Although I love the springy feeling of my Litespeed's Ti frame, the Trek is more direct, and lively than I expected and is also more comfortable after 80 miles and 8,000 ft of climbing. Power transfer is immediate with no BB flex, even with my 180 lbs standing on the pedals. 
The Ksyrium SL's are stiff, light and strong - well worth the upgrade. 
Shifting with new Ultegra 10v gruppo is smooth, quick and quiet - thought about getting a compact crank for tougher climbs, but this bike doesn't need it!

Paint is just OK, would have liked more bare carbon, but didn't buy it for the looks. can be a tough bike to get, but worked with a great bike shop to get it in, built up and a perfect fit - thanks ST!

Strength:
Smooth, glassy like power transfer to the rear wheel.
Sturdy, confidence inspiring frame
Absorbs small road bumps
Great on long rides


Weakness:
LBS changed out: (1)stock wheels for Mavic Open Pro ceramic rims, (2) stock hubs for ultegra, (3)stock tires for Continental 3000 GPs, (4)stock seat for specialized - now trying a Koobi Enduro, (5) stock chain for a whippermann.


Very light and sturdy. Confidence inspiring on fast downhills. Great for long rides. I ride about 5,000 miles per season with a mix of 50 mile rides and 120 mile rides. Compared to my 2004 trek 2300, the Madone 5.2SL absorbs small road bumps better and feels more like I am riding on ice skates - zero friction, direct power transfer. There is something about the drive train that is glassy smooth and makes me feel like my power is being directly transfered to the rear wheel from the crank. It is smoother than my trek 2300. It may be the different crank or a combination of the crank and frame. This smooth power transfer is probably the most noticeable difference between the bikes followed by the frames ability to better absorb the smaller road bumps.

Strength:
Made for long rides; it spares your body.
Rigid thus secure and predictable in downhills.
Efficient.


Weakness:
No character; a very predictable bike. Not nervous at all. If you're lightweighted and a climber, the ""kick in the butt"" will miss you when attacking.
Some Bonetrager components aren't that good: the saddle, the wheels (X Lite) and the bar.


Definitely an excellent and efficient bike, though lack of character.

My previous bike (Colnago Altec2) was a very nervous one and when I first rode the Trek, I was immediatelly disappointed. It took me 1000miles to appreciate its efficiency. It is highly rigid and very secure in downhill. I can ride hours without being totally spent out because I had to fight with the bike.
The new Ultegra 10v is incredibly precise, though the chain has to be changed more often than on a 9v.

On the downsides; I still miss the kick in the butt of more nervous bikes (I'm a lightweighted rider) and I'm not pleased at all by some Bonetrager components. Maybe that the ""top line"" components are better, but some of those delivered with the Trek are an insult to the frame. 
First the saddle needs to be changed.
The wheels are heavy and not stiff enough.
I couldn't get used to the bar ergonomical design. I guess it's personal, but I couldn't find a set up that fitted my riding style.

Great bike, but not for casual riding with the kids. Requires some attention (as compared to other bike, Litespeed Tuscany). Mostly stock Trek & Bontrager except Deda stem, Look Keo pedals, and SI saddle. Bontrager carbon bar deserves a special mention as a must-have component.

Absolutely a great riding bike. Great on the hills, accelerates well on sprints and is comfortable for the long ride. I have plenty of energy left at the end of a 65 mile race. I can sprint and climb with the group. I also love it on the rough roads. I have had the bike about a week and have about 200 miles on it. It has been a great week. While it is an expensive bike, I feel it is a great value. The frame is the same as the 5.9 and the components are Ultegra. I would love slightly lighter wheels but the racelites seem like good wheels for training.

Strength:
The weight and quickness of the bike. How it handles and it's comfort


Weakness:
Price, God you have to sell your first born for it. But worth it, if you want the best :)


Before I purchased this bike I promised myself that I would also ride a Specialized Roubaix. The Roubaix is more of a comfort road bike design while the 5.2 SL is more of a racer. I was very impressed with the Specialized, so impressed that it started to throw my choice for the 5.2 SL. The Specialized is a comfortable bike, at least the Roubaix Elite is. But I wanted more of a race style bike. It's really hard to tell what bike you will want when you only get to test ride it around the parking lot. There are no hills, long flats or sprints to see how the bike performs. Honestly it does not give a race bike a chance to woo you. Remember that a race bike like this is just that, to be raced and climbed, not test ridden in a parking lot. It’s like test driving a Ferrari over speed bumps. I rode the bike for the first time yesterday (07/14/05) and it is really unbelievable. I rode a ‘99 Trek 2300 and the 5.2 SL tumbles over this bike. It is truly an amazing bike. The first 5 miles it took me a little while to get use to it. I think that this is true with just about any new bike. After those 5 miles were up I started to get into the grove with it. This bike is so light it will simply make you grin. It will climb a hill and when you get to the top all you can do is laugh because it should have been harder for you. On a straight away this bike is so quiet and extremely fast it will have you wanting more. After about 15 miles of bumpy road, hills and flats I took it home. About 30 minutes later I wanted to ride it again. It is very nimble and can sprint with very little effort. To get this bike up to speed is painless. Two pumps and you’re gone. Being all carbon fiber the bike absorbs a lot of road chatter which will make longer rides easier and more enjoyable. The down side is the price, yes, it is expensive and perhaps the purchaser is a little off his/her rocker, but once you buy this bike you will never have to buy another one. If you have to sell it, chances are you will get a very good price for it as well. If you want a race bike I think you would be crazy not to at least entertain the possibility of giving this bike a shot. You will be excited with it. I love this bike and cannot imagine riding anything else but this bike. It is quite a jump from what I had before but it is worth it when I take it out to ride. Just plain fun. If you would like to ask me questions about this bike feel free. You can mail me at [cowjuicer AT gmail.com]. I will be happy to answer your questions. By the way I do not work for a bike shop or any bike company. I am a simple computer programmer. Hope to see more posts here.

This is a review of the 5.2SL, which is essentially the same bike, only w/ Ultegra 10sp. With just over 100 miles logged, all I can say is WOW. This bike is firm and stable. Climbs as quickly as my legs will push it and decends with surety. I went Project One, and the finish was flawless. Compared to my old aluminum bike, this is like riding on a stick of butter. Project One also allows some upgrade / switching of components, which really allows a customized bike. I settled on the 5.2 because I was more cost than gram conscious with regard to drive train. It took about 6 weeks from order to arrival.

Weakness:

This is a review for the Madone 5.2 SL, which is the same exact frame Lance rode in Alps D'Huez in '04 (not the SSL). I switched the wheelset to Kysrium Elite and paid $80 extra. I didn't want the Bontrager RL's that came with it because of the horror stories that I've heard about it. 
First of all, you will really feel how light this bike is when you start pushing it. I have a 50cm frame (48 actual) and I could actually feel it kinda jerking forward as I pedal harder, which makes me shift one gear up than normal.
As for the feel of the bike, this frame is definitely more stable (fast decents)and lighter than the 5200. As for the age old debate of comparing carbon frames with metal ones (steel, aluminum, titanium, magnesium. etc.), I have one thing to say, well..maybe a lot.
Carbon just absorbs vibration better than steel, aluminum,etc. PERIOD! With this bike, you do not feel that constant zing vibration in your a** all day. Maybe if you are an old school rider like my dad, you wouldn't like that ""numb"" feeling on a carbon bike but who in the world wants to have a beat up and sore butt at the end of the day? I'm pretty sure that I'm not one of 'em.

Incredibly smooth ride, firm acceleration, and decent braking. Silky smooth shifting which needs little maintenance. Good looking frame.

Still a little on the heavy side compared to the Madone series, but still a great value for the price. Ultegra brakes are average.


Great upgrade from my previous aluminum frame bike with down tube shifters. The bike rides very smoothly, pedaling is very efficient and there's no noticeable frame flex during hard sprints. It's a good step up from the Trek 1000/1500 level. Good for riders with a few years of experience.

This review is for the 2004 blue team version frame only. I got this frame as an upgrade from my current Trek 1000. It is my first carbon fiber frame and it was a huge improvement from the aluminum. The bike is stiff and absorbs road bumps very nicely. Although the frame was already used with some miles on it, after one year of riding it, the ride still feels very smooth. Some people have mentioned some flex at the bottom bracket area, which there is, but not as bad as the aluminum. One thing I did notice after riding both bikes was how stiff it was at the head tube.

Weakness:
Didn't survive the hit from a 55 mph Ford Mustang. Fortunately, I barely did!


This is more of an epitaph than a review. I rode my 5200 for nine seasons, until I was hit by a hit-and-run driver. The direct hit was from behind, by a Ford Mustang @ 55 MPH. I was nearly killed, thrown 50 feet and landed on my Giro Helmet. I have permanent shoulder damage, and constant neck and back pain, but I'm ready to cycle again (you know....getting back on that horse)! I carried my 5200 with me all the time in my car, and rode every day, weather permitting. I truly loved my 5200, now trashed, and will be replacing it with a Project One 5.2 Dura-Ace. My 5200 gets a 5 out of 5 for everything, and I'll miss it. Hopefully the 5.2 will fill the void. $5500 to replace a $2800 bike. Oh well....you get what you pay for! QUALITY! Be careful. Stuff happens!

Excellent handling, secure descents, smooth ride.


Weakness:
Original Bontrager Race fork (adequate, but this bike deserves better)


This bike is a replacement for the aluminum 2200 I've had since 2005. That bike, with the right component mix, made me a fan of Trek. It was damaged in a collision early this year, but I liked it well through 15,000 miles of riding that my first inclination was to restore it to its previous condition and keep it for a couple more years--but then I discovered that the head tube had become ovalized, so the frame needed to be replaced. A pristine 5200 with upgrades was being offered on eBay, and the final price was a bit less than the shop quoted to put my 2200 right again. I've been very happy with this bike, especially after swapping its Ksyrium Elite wheels for Velomax Circuits, which I had been riding before, and after upgrading the fork from a Bontrager Race to a Race X Lite. Initially, I found the ride harsh on rough pavement, but now it's quite smooth. The better fork makes a big difference there and will keep me from lusting after a Madone for a while. Both of my Trek bikes have been a joy to ride, and I've never felt as if I was being held back at all--and I do like to go fast, for someone who doesn't race. Everything works well, and cornering is secure. One way in which this 5200 distinguishes itself from the earlier bike is that it feels steadier at speeds over 30 mph. The 2200 was fine, but this bike feels as if it's attached to the road.

This is an amazing bike. I have ridden Bianchi, Specialized and Ciocc. The 5200 beats them all. I ride this on the road as weather permits in the pacific northwest, and indoors on a trainer when not. The ride is amazingly smooth - responsive in tight turns, when you need to put the hammer down and especially when climbing. The sizing is critical so make sure you take the time to get your bike sized for your weight/height/build. You will be amazed at the ride you get...will not be disappointed.

Wheels are susceptible to cracks.


This is a great bike. I've ridden 5000+ miles in all sorts of conditions: city riding, races, even a touring stint with a seat post rack. Mostly regular road riding, however.  It soaks up shocks wonderfully and handles like a dream. I've done only minor tune-ups over two years, and have never had a problem. The wheels are a major weakness. I developed major cracks in the rim, and had to buy a new set of wheels after 4000 miles. It seems lots of bontrager wheels have this problem. Tires are so-so, had to be replaced after 2000+ miles. Definitely don't get Bontrager wheels, however.

Proven quality and durability. Light. Strong frame. Soft ride. Climbs well. Stable at high speed.


Weakness:
extremely tempting for thieves ;)


I am new to road biking and a long time trail rider. I purchased the bike used, I am the 3rd owner. The day I purchased the bike it was raining and I couldn't test it. I decided to ""go for it"" on the strength of the review in this forum (thanks!) I freaking love this bike!! My first ride was going to be around the block to get a feel and get use to the toe clips. 40km later I was in love lol! It's smooth, light and fast as hell. 6 strides and your up to 30km keep pushing and you'll hit 50 on flat ground. The bumps are no where near as bad as I thought for a road bike and it corners way better than I'm ready for yet. Yesterday was my 3rd ride and first medium down hill. I toped out at 68km/h way faster than I should be going at this point but I didn't realize it till I was at the bottom :) so be warned this bike is fast! If your looking for a road bike get this one!!

Strength:
Great, strong all rounder. Very comfortable, stiff and stable on climbs and descents. Still looks like new. Great paint, finish and quality. Very underestimated and a true classic.


Weakness:
Original headset only lasted a year, get a King they’re the best. If you get caught in the rain, the seat tube and B/B fills with water. You have to remove the post and tip it over to drain!


I’ve ridden this bike the last 4 years (summer use only) and have put 6780 miles on it. What can I say about it that hasn’t been said before. A fantastic bike and great all rounder. Stiff enough for climbing and technical descents and also very comfy over long distances with just the right amount of road feel getting to your hands etc. I swapped to Ksyrium SL wheels after 6 months use and they are really worth the upgrade over the original Race lites and noticeably lighter. I also own a new Madone 5.2 with Dura-Ace, but the 5200 still calls me when I walk by it in the garage begging to be ridden. A totally different ride to the Madone. Where the new Madone glides over rougher roads and is certainly lighter (2.5lbs), and smoother, I still love the feel and feedback of the 5200. If I’d have realised this sooner I’d have most definably upgraded the components saved a lot of money and been just as smitten.

Strength:
This is the best bike I have ever ridden. The design of the bike is excellent, it is just like the one you seen on the Tour de France who Lance Armstrong used it. Although it has minimal spokes on the wheel, it is unbelievably strong. The Ultegra components are excellent, very sharp, responsive and reliable. I like the shape of the bike, it makes climbing easy. It looks very smart as well. Make sure you get the right size, and you can feel the difference compared to most bikes. I think it is the best carbo fibre bikes range you could get with this amount of money. Plus peace of mind, because Trek offers lifetime warranty for the carbo frame.


Weakness:
It is a perfect machine, the person has to train harder. The Bontrager saddle is rubbish, as it looks clumsy, and uncomfortable at all. I sold it straight away on Ebay. But, I assume, it makes the price of the bike lower as everyone has preference on saddle.


Responsive, Strong, Light and Comfortable

Great bike! Super ride. However, this model has the original carbon frame style (with the old fork style seat stay) and an Ultegra nine speed. Trek has made more stylish frames since, so this one looks dated after just a few years.

This bike is amazing. After being away from the sport for a few years, I wanted to get something that was light, comfortable, precise and made in the U.S. The 5200 addresses all of those requirements and then some. The bike is smooth and quick on the flats and just loves to climb. This is my first carbon bike and I can easily see this being in the stable for years and years. The Ultegra components make shifting easy and the Bonty components round out a great machine. I am very happy with this purchase. I bought this on clearance at the end of the model year.

Weakness:
My chain seems to come off periodically, although it hasn't been a real problem.


I went from a Trek 1000 to this Trek 5200 and the difference was pretty amazing. The ride is smooth and on the flats this bike just wants to take off. My Trek 1000 is a triple and this is a double, but the difference in weight (this bike is considerably ligher) really makes this a better climber. I've found this to be an excellent overall bike. It's light - at about 18.5 lbs. - and it climbs with confidence. For those of you who haven't tried a carbon fiber frame, this is a real treat!

Weakness:
The Bontrager Race wheels seem a bit fragile, my rear wheel doesn't like to stay true. The tires pretty much suck, I don't think that they corner very well. I can't wait unitl they are worn out so I can get new ones without feeling guilty. The seat sucks. I guess they figured most people would replace it anyways.


Actually a 2006 Fantastic value. You pay for the carbon but it is so smooth and descends like a champ. A bit of flex when out of the saddle, but if you don't mash the peddles too hard it climbs wonderfully. I find it stable on the bumpy descents (west Alpine, west OLH) and silky on everything else I know its discontinued but maybe that makes it the perfect time to buy.

I talked myself into this full carbon very easily. This bike fees really great - not one complaint after 300km. I am riding twice as far as I used to with less effort. Maybe this is because I am $2000 lighter! That all said I had a 1992 Holdsworth 531 with downshifters. I bought more bike than I need, and I'm glad I did. $2000 is more than I intended to spend, and even with the closeout reduction it's seems steep to me.

Weakness:
Everyone has one! Saddle. Trek's have a long top tube, so sizing can be a little tricky.


My 5200 has far exceeded my expectations. I've put about 10,000 miles on it in the past 2+ years and I really do not have a complaint. The bike is very responsive, corners fantastic and descends like a bomb. The CF frame is certainly more supple than say the early model madones, but certainly has plenty of responsiveness for any non-pro. About 8000 miles have been on the race lites and they haven't needed truing and are a great training wheelset. I recently did the triple bypass (120 miles over three CO mtn passes) and didn't have a single complaint about the bike afterwards. I did replace the saddle with a Fizik Arione, but otherwise the bike remains as purchased.

This review is for a 2006, not a 2005.  I absolutely love this bike! The CF frame really gives an incredibly smooth ride--this bike just quietly glides along. And the Ultegra components are very smooth and solid. I haven't ridden any really high end bikes, but for my riding style (20-40 mile rides with an occassional metric or century) the 5200 is perfect! My only complaint is the stock saddle, which I replaced after my first ride. Also, going with the compact double and the 12-27 cassette gives me the range of a triple with the exception of only the highest and lowest gear. A great alternative in my view. Bike King in Clinton, NJ gave me a price $400 less than the nearest competitor and swapped the components dollar for dollar with no labor charges - I recommend them highly

Strength:
Smooths out the bumps, accelerates very quickly, especially with the Velomax wheels on it. Used it for light touring. I got the last model with rear drop-outs drilled for rack mounts. The triple was great, but the paniers on back made it less stable, not the fault of the bike, just stretched its utility too far. I had problems with the left STI shifter (my fault for letting residue from sports drinks drip under the BB and lock up the cable, then trying to force the shift anyway). Shimano replaced it for free even though it was really a user caused problem.


Weakness:
The seat it came with tore me a new one (San Marco ERA). Too narrow for me. Replaced it with a Fizik Aliante and have had no problems since.


Was riding an old, steel Medici pro bike with down tube shifters, so this was a big change. More twitchy than the old bike, but I needed to smooth out my stroke anyway. (I converted the old bike to a fixed gear and got smoother, or else!) It climbed like a dream. Just put Easton Velomax Orion's on it and am in heaven. Can just about guarantee that shifting problems mentioned above are adjustment problems. Even shop wrenches don't always get triples right.

Bike is actually a 20006 5200 that I received for Christmass 2005. The bike is super light. It makes climbing a so much easier than the Chromoly/Aluminium Giant OCR3 that I had. Cornering is sharp. The bike accelerates super fast. The Ultergra 10 with the double chain ring shifts really smooth. Any energy that you place into the bike you get back. If you listen real closely you can almost hear the bike laughing at you because anything that you put into it it asks ""is that all that you got"".I have got over 2900 miles since January.

Price was awesome during the tour Mania sale MSRP on Treks wesite is over $2700, I got it on sale at Chain reaction in Redwood City for $1999


Weakness:
Not offered in Team colors!


This bike is the 2006 model I just got on July 1.  The last road bike I had was a peugeout in the 80's that I used to get around Germany. I am a runner and recently decied to get into road bikes in order to prolong my knees. Anyway, I decided I wanted a full carbon bike with all Ultegra gear and the 5200 hgas both and hey if it was good enough for Lance its good enough for me. Although I dont really have anything to compare it to, I did test ride a bunch of other brands and models prior to buying. I took it out for the first time yesterday on a road course that I have been riding on my MTB until getting this Trek. What I can say is that I cannot imagine a road bike being any better than this Trek. It has a smooth ride, shifts are quick and flawless and the seat doesn't even bother me. Overall I am very excited about this bike and am convinced I made the right choice in the Trek 5200!

the bike is actually a 2006 and i got it for a steal! thanks to Rick in Elko, Nevada for hooking us Cali boys up! Bike is such a good upgrade from my LeMond Tourmalet...accelerates so much faster and corners like my old generation Specialized Sirrus but sooo much lighter than the steel frame...so far, the hills of San Francisco have been a great proving ground for using my new carbon frame and it works like a dream! it's just too bad there aren't any roadies in Elko, Nevada---but good for us tourists visiting! ;-)

Strength:
- Riding on the same frame that Lance used for his 1st Tour de France victory- Amazingly smooth and comfortable on long rides.- Able to cruise and keep up with the big boys in triathlon races.


Weakness:
- Would like a compact double crank with the shimano 10 on the back.


AWESOME BIKE! I got this bike as a year old model in April of 05'. I was going back and forth between the Trek 5000 and the Felt F55 (another great looking bike, that has much better components but an aluminum frame). Then I found a year old 5200 at a reduced price and snatched it up. I couldn't bring myslef to pay $2k for the trek 5000 and getting shimano 105 components. I'm glad to see that Trek is selling the 5200 again this year. I used the bike in about 10 triathlons & duathlons last year and loved it. It was equally as nice on a slow 50 mile ride. My buddy just picked up an 06' Felt F55. I plan on trying it out soon to see if I'm happy with my decision (I'm 99.999% that I will be). The 5200 rides super smooth and is crazy light. The bike came with the Ultegra triple and I hope to upgrade to a FSA compact double next year.

Strength:
quite ride/start-stop reaction.


Weakness:
Occassional shifting issues.


60cm ultegra throughout and added aero bars. Ride has been smooth and comfortable so far with 250mi in the first two weeks of ownership. The only problem so far is the shifting has skipped and/or not reacted in two of the gears. I will have to assess this over the next few weeks to see if this continues. The seat is fair and is suitable with a good pair of pants. Overall this is a great bike and picks up speed fast when required. Top end speed on flats was just short of 30mph.

I like this machine very much and at my level of riding it is all the bike I will ever need. I just finished a 100K club ride, my first of the season, and I was totaly comfortable. Very smooth and agile without being twitchy. The only changes from stock are a Selle Italia gel-flow sadle and Michelin Pro-race tires. There are 2,327km on it since it was purchased and no problems except the up shift on the front derailure could be crisper. I like the look of the 2003 paint and grafix. No problems with paint or decals. (it's a 2003 bought two years ago)

I just purchased my first road bike and all I can say is WOW!! I have been on a mountain bike for years, but the smoothness, quality, and feel of my 2006 OCLV 5200 is simply amazing. Components shift quickly and precisely. I consider it the Porsche of road bikes. Fast and corners exceptionally!! No vibration or feedback from the road, say goodbye to numbness, the carbon frame soaks up everything. Saddle is excellent. Trek has delivered yet again, this model is a work of ART!!

the Ultegra front deraileur shifter - total garbage


Frame: absolutely top level, light, responsive, and with a great capacity to absorb road vibrations.

The Ultegra groupset: OK with one notable exception: the front deraileur shifter. It was impossible to adjust it so that it would not force the chain off the rings when downshifting once in a while. If that happens in a race at the foot of a climb and then you have to chase back...
I switched to Campagnolo Chorus, and Ridley 4ZA compact crankset, and never looked back.

Bontrager wheels: reasonably light and stiff. After three years of use, still no complaints.

Strength:
Climbs great, shifts smooth, and corners well. I love the feel of the carbon frame. At first it feels kind of dead after being used to an aluminum frame but after about an hour ridding it I would never go back. This bike is simply a joy to ride.


Weakness:
Price: It seems like a lot considering I can get the compenent group & all the other stuff for about $1000. That means I'm paying $1400 for a frame?

I can't seem to get the front derailer adjusted right? Don't know if its me, the bike, or the derailer yet? Anyway right now the chain seems to fall off at least once or twice a ride. Maybe it has something to do with me not using the half shift thing on the 10 speed right?

Seems like it should come with peddles?

Stupid thing: I got the bike with reflectors on it (guess they have to send it out the door this way) and both broke off during various rides during my first month of riding.


The bike is actually an 06. I do not really need a bike this nice but the store only had a Madone in a 54 for me to test ride & and I fell in love with the ride. Not wanting to shell out 3k for the Madone I took the next best thing the 5200.

The bike is really smooth to ride & climbs like a champ.

Guess I should say my road experience is somewhat limited back in collage I did some bike events (delmac & ms150's) on my mountain bike decided I would try a road bike and got a deal on a Colnago Team bike that did not really fit me right as a result I hated it & went back to mountain biking. I decided to sign up for the MS150 again and decided it was time to try a road bike this year. I went in to buy something under 1k and ended up with this :). Lately I have been really enjoying being a roadie & I think I'm going to stick with it because of this bike! I still love trail riding but now I have a little variety!

Strength:
Stiffness, cornering (really stable), comfort over bumps (felt like riding in my car), acceleration.


Weakness:
Seat was OK, but not great. Would change over to a carbon wing handlebar, as well. Stock one is comfortable, but nothing matches a good carbon wing.


Great ride at an affordable price. Had tested the Madone 5.2 and found this to be as comfortable and as stable in hard turns. This was actually a 2006 with the Ultegra 10-speed cassette. Shifts are sleek and smooth. Great hill climber and great acceleration away from a stop light.

The stock seat is passable, but I will be switching over my Fizik Arione from my other ride.

Was really surprised at the stiffness and comfort of this bike, especially for the price. Also test rode Cannondale (aluminum), Specialized (carbon), Scattante (carbon), Lemond (carbon), and Trek Madone 5.2. Only the 5.2 was comparable but at about $600 more.

Strength:
Quick and responsive. I can bust out from a stop light to max speed in no time. Acceleration is scary. Downhill is too fast but fun. I can goto work in about double the time it takes to drive so saves on gas.


Weakness:
Uphill is not fun with Shimano R-540s (1900+ grams) but I'll put a stop to that soon. People get mad when I pass them.


This bike is all about acceleration even with my weighty wheels. 

At 6'2"" I may be too tall for this 58cm frame, but I have nothing to compare it to, so..seems to work fine. Also, this is 2 casset and I ride on mountainous rodes so in desperate need of new wheels to get in a good ratio.

This bike explodes from a stand-still and is very smooth while riding. I'm glade that I didn't get a Specialized Roubauix whatever as I don't think it would explode like this Trek 5200 does.

With the right seat it is also every bit as comfortable. I switch out the hard-as-a-rock one for my mountain bike Serfas Doctor's RX seat. Yeah it's heavier but it allows bloodflow to reach the legs and prevents prostate cancer.

I need a new headset too - forthcoming. I went for this bike because the Madone is only 100 grams lighter and is rather hard to come by..and costs about $2k more. 

I'm not a weight weenie, just a proud owner of the 5200, which more than holds it's own on the road. You have the ability to turn up the juice on this bike from brain to foot to asphalt.

Strength:
Very lite and responsive. Stock setup is very good and fits like a glove. My seat pack is heavier than any single component on the bike.


Weakness:
Bontrager tires were very lite, but experienced 2 flats in 200 miles. Switched to Michelin Pro Race and haven't looked back.


I'm 6'3"" tall and 180lbs. When I went to purchase a new road bike, I had 2 choices; one LeMond and the Trek 5200. After taking a test ride on the Trek, I was sold. This bike wants to do one thing: Go FAST! This bike makes no noise except hum (and I'm not kidding, it really hums when you're riding).

The 60cm frame fit me like a glove. The only required adjustment was to move the seat back 2mm.

I have had no complaints with the stock setup. I find that the frame is stiff and responsive. It corners like it's glued to the road, and climbs like a goat. Every watt I input, gets transferred to going forward. 

The only problem I've had is that I have to ride my brake when going downhill in a group.

As far as the decals go, I personally like them. I think it adds to the race worthiness of the bike.

I have been so happy with the Bontrager wheelset, that I'm seriously thinking about purchasing the Race X Lite Aero.

First I would like to remind the person who posted Lances comments about the first tour equipment being inferior
He was more or less talking about his tt bike.
You forget Lances quote after winning the 1999 tour “I’ve been riding custom bikes throughout my career and Trek is the best,” 
said Lance. “I still can’t believe I ride a stock production bike.”
I think the Trek 5200 is stiff and responsive super smooth a joy to ride.
I rode a steel frame for years and I always felt like I have been beat to death after a long ride not with the Trek I feel like the bike just wants to go.

Weakness:
Flexy dead ride. Bad paint job.


Trek needs to be happy Lance Armstrong came along, becuase they owe more thanks to him than the engineers who designed this frame. The frame feels soft, and it seemed to absorb the energy I put into the bike. Therefore, sprinting and climbing is handicapped by the frame. Everyone thinks jsut because Lance rode it, it is a great frame. He was quoted recently saying that the stuff they won on during the first tour was technologically inferior. I agree, and feel he would have dominated even more had he a stiffer frame. Supposedly, Trek has worked on the stiffness in the latter tour frames. There are far better carbon frames out there than this, so do yourself a favor and don't let Lance make your decision when it comes to the bike. Go out and ride a good variety of carbon bikes, and you will see that TREK OCLV is clearly inferior.

Strength:
-Handling is stable yet agile.
-Does everything very well (climbs, accelerates,etc.)
-Delivers a silky ride over anything but the larger bumps
-Aesthetically pleasing (I like the ""shark fin"").


Weakness:
-Saddle...Bontrage race lux is too soft and squishy
-Ride quality can be harsh over larger bumps
-Does everything very good but will not make you a better rider by itself
-Peeling decals on Bontrager race-lite wheels
-Jury still out on rear hub


This is a review of the 2005 Madone 5.2 with Ultegra 10. 

Aesthetics/Finish: I opted for the nude carbon/black stock version. Bike looks much better in person than in pictures. There are some blemishes to the painted stripes and clear coat but otherwise of very good quality. Fork on mine is without stripes that are present in catalog. Ultegra 10 finish is nice...polished aluminum except for the chainrings. Chainring finish took some getting used to as they are grey anodized finish, now I like how this camoflauges the oil from the chain. Some sticker peeling on the Bontrager race-lite wheels, otherwise they look good. 

Ride Quality: This bike is stiff. Very little frame flex during hard efforts and very good at out-of-the-saddle accelerations. Stiffness may come at a price as it can sting you over hard bumps. The bike glides over the small stuff but knocks you pretty well over larger ones. From what I understand this is different than with the 5200. Maybe the redesigned frame is repsonsible as it is made with the same 120 OCLV. In short this bike does everything very good, from grinding up steep climbs to spinning in high RPMs on the flats. Didn't notice that I was flying up climbs though, maybe I was one cog up at the same perceived effort level. I believe my bike with pedals and cages weighs a tad over 18 lbs. This bike does everything that I ask of it without any sign of weakness but I don't get the feeling that I am a better rider because of it (unlike some other bikes that have a unique way of doing this). 

Ultegra 10/ other components: Maybe too early to give a full review but Ultegra 10 delivers so far. Looks and finish are great as are the vital functions (shifting, braking, ergonomics). Left lever rattles over large bumps but not due to loose internal construction as I can stop this by applying light pressure on brake lever. Rear bontrager hub is quiet but does not freewheel as long as other hubs (noticed reduced wheelspin time). I am still unsure how this translates to forward momentum but I sense that I slow down quicker when I stop pedaling compared to other bikes. This may be just in my head though. Additionally make sure to deep-six the Bontrager saddle. Too much padding that puts pressure on undesirable areas (SPAB).

Strength:
This is really more bike than anyone needs unless people are giving you bikes. The frame is the highlight, but the wheels and components are just fine too. Well, better than just fine. I wondered if the house brand (Bontrager) and 105 stuff would be good enough, but that was silly; it's great stuff. Older reviews didn't like the Shimano brake pads, but I think they must have changed because they seem fine. I got lucky because the stock saddle from last year's bike seems to work well for me, and the LBS swapped it. I never rode anything with aero rims or flat spokes, and it's obvious that this is a big improvement.


Weakness:
The stock headset (Cane Creek) is just a piece of junk. I mean really really junk. It was garbage after 100 miles! It didn't even get wet before it was junk! My LBS put a Chris King on and did the labor for free. This year's saddle didn't work for me.


I rode a fair amount ""back in the day."" After many years off, I was looking for a new bike that would be fun and fast, but I'm not going to race any more. I felt a little silly walking in to shops and looking at bikes in this price range and then saying, ""um, ah, how do you shift it?""

WOW! Things changed in 20 years. I started out thinking I would buy a Trek, but after looking at the specs versus a Cannondale R1000, I thought I would get the Cannondale. Then I rode them. The Cannondale was great and lively, but I'm not 20, and I just didn't like the ride as much. 

I love the way the Trek frame and fork feel. The ""new"" oversized bar and stem with the 1 1/8 fork make a really stiff front. It's stable and comfortable and lively and quick; how can one bike be all those things? I thought about a 2100, and I'd suspect it's a great value, but I really wanted the frame and fork on this bike.

Weight, stiffness, geometry. Wheelset is solid.


Weakness:
Bonty Xlite tires cut easily. Blemishes on the seatstays under the clear coat. Stickers peel easily.


I raced CAT 2 in my college years, but then gave up cycling for 10 years afterwards. Got a MTB to screw around with two years ago, then decided that I missed the feeling of road bikes. I'm amazed about the changes in technology, particularly brifters, low spoke count wheels and carbon frames. 
I looked at a Trek 2300, then decided to test a '04 5200 that my shop had in stock. Difference was night and day. While the AL frame was stiff and responsive enough, the 5200 was just... smooth...I wasn't too sure about the durability of carbon, but my LBS all but guaranteed that anything that would hurt the frame would just as easily mash any other material, and that the Trek warranty was solid.
I've averaged around 150-200km over the weekends since getting the bike, mostly flat rides averaging 32-35kph, and the smoothness of the ride never seeks to amaze me. Climbs and sprints well, Race Lite set has stayed true and the Ultegra group is solid overall. Am still getting used to the San Marco seat, might switch to Fizik or a Flite. Still sorting out the reach - was fitted with a 54 for my size (173cm tall, 30i inseam), but have already flipped the stem and moved the spacers up to lower the bars. Overall, highly recommended!

Strength:
Stiff, fast and handles very well. Feels much more refined then many bikes. Very light for the $$.


Weakness:
Headset stinks, but everythig else holds up well. The Bontrager tires last about 600 miles on the back, but I will be gettin well over a 1000 miles on the new Vrederstein Tri Comps. They are definitely faster rolling too!


I am a big guy at 245lbs. I had to swap out the original triple for the double crank because I was having issues with frame flex. It may have had something to do with my 289lbs self at the time. Once I had the double I never regreted the change over.

I will say this bike is smooth, but is stiff too. If you are looking for a bike in this price range I can't think of anything better. I will tell you that the S2 headset stinks. I have gone through two. The first was a victim of a 35 mile ride in the rain on a century at over 20mph in which the frame filled up with water. Yes it does, but I have ridden 5 miles before on numerous occasion in rain with no water collecting troubles. The headset on the other hand needed to be replaced a second time and I put Chris King on to stop that. Other than that I love the bike stock.

I would recomment the Bontrager Aeor X-lites. They seem to make the bike faster and even more smooth. Also, on the windier days they help out in 23-26pmh range. That is the only major upgrade I have made except for the headset. 

As for the 5000, the 5200 worth the extra $500 if you are someone that can tell the better components from ok components and the nicer wheels from so so wheels. I have ridden both and there is a BIG difference between Ultegra and 105.

If you are considering a new Trek give Dave at Bikers Choice in Hendersonville a call because he will get you fitted on the bike correctly and he will take care of you after the sale.

Strength:
Weight, climbing and comfort. This is a fast bike for long rides. Saddle not bad though is showing wear. I like both the stock bontrager race lite wheels and my race x lites. No problems and fast. Stock bontrager tires wore well but I replaced them with Conti (which were terrible for cuts) and specializes Mondo s works that have been great. (I really don't like Continenals as they are difficult to mount and unmount and seem to cut easier than butter...I had 3 conti tires that did this, but not my bontragers and not my specialized and not the Michelen pro race on my xlites.)


Weakness:
The carbon finish appears blimished. Not as pristine as my old 2300 carbon Trek road bike. Water in frame after rain rides. Though these have been heavy rains endured in ultra distance rides.


This is my second Trek the first being a 3/2 carbon 2300 I bought in 1992. I have put over 3000 miles on the '04 5200 since Jan.and could not be pleased more. Bike climbs like a goat, responsive and the right geometry for me. Rain is a problem. I ride seldom if ever in rain, and only if caught in it. However, when cought, the frame seems to collect water and the bottom bracket needs ""draining"". I have had some quality miles on this bike, a few minor accidents and it still rides like a dream. Solid bike.

Well three months, a century, couple of fun rides, and a few serious rides, this bike is great! Went from the fire engine red Trek 2200 to this and I swear, this thing is as stiff as a board. The frame absorbs vibrations so well. It climbs like a goat and is safe when bombing down a hill. Best money I've spent on a bike.

I'm sure the 5.9 is a better bike but I'm not so sure the extra cost would provide much more performance. This bike is DA BOMB! Looks good, climbs like a goat, absorbs the road rattle, transfers power direclty to the wheels, hard to keep it under the speed limit!


Weakness:
I've only put a few hundred miles on it so I'll come back if anything pops up. So far, the only things I didn't care for was the bars & saddle. Both of these are personal preferances so someone else might absolutely love them.


I'm actually reviewing the '05 Madone 5.2. I'm doing it here for obvious reasons - the bike is not listed and it's pretty much the replacement for the 5200.

WOW! What a bike! I had a Fuji R. Pro before this and the comparison must be like a Porche to a Ford Focus.

Everything is better - my climbs are faster, my flats are faster, etc. etc. The bike absorbs the bumps much better and Ultegra versus 105's - need I say more!

If you're wondering if a bike can really make a difference in your riding pleasure, speed, etc. the answer is a resounding YES!

no jarring, no vibration, yet stiff as can be


Weakness:

i agonized a lot last year about whether to get the 5200, decided to wait, and just got the 2005 5000 (note to eds: which doesn't have its own forum yet!). boy am i glad! i grew up using a super-cheap old cannondale frame with upgraded components, and it beat me up something awful on long rides. the 5000 on the other hand is smooth as butter on long rides, plus crazy light and stiff as a board. the guys at the lbs also did a great job fitting the bike with new stems and so forth. its definitely an extravagance for someone who just rides about times during the week (sometimes on the trainer) and then once or twice a weekend, but if you want something that makes you feel great the whole time you're riding, this is the machine...

i test rode the 5000 against some 2004 5200s (still going for $2500) and think this is the way to go if you want a basic CF frame. the 2005 model has the same fork and seatpost now as the 5200 (and a better paint job, imho) with the only differences being (1) a bontrager-branded integrated bottom bracket and crank, (2) 105 brakes and front derailleur, and (3) slightly heavier wheelset. the brakes and wheelset's added weight will not be noticed by anyone other than a racer and the guys as the bike shop were creaming over the crank (i of course have no idea if it's really so much better--felt the same to me as plain old ultegra). but i can't see why the 5200 is really even that better even leaving aside the $500 price difference--and of course you can always upgrade the wheels and brakes later.

Everything except durability in rain


Weakness:
Explained above


Overall, I've been very happy with this bike. I've only used it for less than one season, but I'm happy with everything but the durability of the bike. I've been very careful not to ever ride in the rain or in wet conditions. However, I was caught up in an un-expected storm about a month ago a few miles from home and the bike did get quite wet. I did my best to dry it out when I got home but did'nt take anything apart (headset, etc). A month later, the bike really started to lose it's performance and the bottom bracket started to squeak. I took it back to where I purchased the bike and was told that the frame was filled with water and components were rusted and non-servicable. It needed a new headset and bottom bracket--overall cost to me was about $250. Trek wouldn't cover any damages because it was caused by rain damage. I know that any kind of bike isn't made to be ridden in the rain, but I feel that a single exposure to rain shouldn't ruin a bike I've since been told that the Cane Creek Headset has been known for it's leaks, but still it's worth noting before you consider this bike

This bike is just about as good as it gets, comfortable ride, eats hills for breakfast, fast and responsive. I run triathlons and I don't want to get off the bike. I probably can't swim now because I spend all my time on the bike.

If you are looking for a entry level CF bike this is the one. You'll find that there are 2 things people will gripe about this bike: 1) The 9 speed Ultegra vs the 10 speed Dura-Ace. But if they wanted the 10 speed Dura-Ace, they could have bought the 5500. And 2) They'll gripe about the stickers. Big deal, if you are going fast enough, no one will see them. 

I have the bike stock and it is running great. Will I upgrade to Dura-Ace? Probably, but that is because I want to race it. 

I too used this board to make my decision on a bike and I am glad I chose the 5200.

Good Luck.

It wasen't machined properly or all the way and created a horrific thunk, thunk while braking on every rotation. but Trek replaced it in timely fasion under warrenty.


My first rroad ride was in a biatholon 6yrs ago. I still know nothing odf bikes but as far as comfort this is the best bike I've riden. Out of the box for around 2grand this bike stands alone. Good stock components, and good company name. I must say if your looking for a good bike and your not pretentious or worried about something small like the paint and are out to ride a good solid yet soft bike with out crying over the decals or clear coat or chipping blah, blah, blah than this is your bike. I'm sure if you feel like becoming an overnite expert you may find better deals. but for someone who has the money and wants to get serious this is the place to start. I've got just over 800 mile on mine and not one scratch and I use a yakima hitch mounted rack and I lay mine down on the grass, up against brick etc. so lets stop complaining about how it looks and talk about it's perfomance

See previous post, in addtion to the Paint quality.


I'm writing after a previous review that I posted. This is still a great riding bike, but after 6 months of use, the paint job SUCKS! I have been extremely disappointed in the durability of the paint. I have multiple chips and scratches that go all the way down to the carbon. Owners should also be cautious when putting this bike on a Yakima hitch-mount rack, as the rubber from the straps burned two nice quarter sized holes in the paint on the top tube. Maybe the carbon fiber is softer than others, I don't know - but the durability has been far less than any of my othe bikes. Unfortunately, the so called ""warranty"" on the paint doesn't cover any of these issues. After forking out the big dollar for this bike, it's a pitty to have to turn around 6 months later and have to pay hundred of dollars to repaint the thing.

What a joy this is to ride. Upgrading from a Trek hybrid, my wife and I started out looking in the $1500 market. Because my local Trek dealer was great in helping fit a variety of bikes both below and above this price for us both to test ride while the Bianchi/Lemond dealer treated us like we were wasting his time, we both pretty quickly decided on Treks. I was pretty close to deciding on the 2200 and she was enamoured of a 2100 when the dealer suggested we at least try riding the 5200. We did so with a lot of scepticism as we are both riding to lose weight and weren't sure that a lightweight CF bike would stand up for us. Deb assured us that we couldn't and wouldn't break these bikes and even if we did, her shop and Trek would make it right.

We both were staggered at the difference between the 5200 and the other bikes we had tried. In my wife's case, her favorable impression was increased as the dealer had a WSD in her size for her to try and she really liked the geometry, the short reach levers, and even the women's saddle. Bottom line, after a lot of soul searching, we both bought a pair of 5200's. (Eat your heart out Bianchi dealer).

I after three months, we are both still thrilled with them. While I admit to still be much of a novice to bikes of this quality, I'm not sure I understand the often stated complaint about CF as being ""wooden""; to me I have no problem feeling the road. What I don't have to put up with is the road buzz that often comes with aluminum rides. I find the 5200 to much more comfortable than even the 7200 with its suspension fork and seat post. This is especially true on rides over 20 miles (It was because our hybrid's were so uncomfortable at any distance over 20 miles that we switched to road bikes in the first place.)I would also toot up the handling and climbing abilities of the 5200 but in fairness, my principal point of comparison is to the hybrid. The Ultegra drive train is simply great.

Usually when I make a purchase of this size, there is at least some ""buyer's regret"" when I second guess was it the right thing to do. Here there has been none. Every time I get on the bike, I am amazed that I own such a great machine. Besides the often criticized finish, the ONLY weakness I've found is that it lacks the bike lust factor of more obscure rides and you have to put up with the assumption from many who have never ridden one that you only bought it bcause of the Lance factor. If only those folks would go ride a 5200. 

There may be other bikes that are as overall great just to ride and some may even be cheaper. In our case, however, when we consider the support we are getting from our LBS including professional fitting along with Trek's warranty and reputation we are very, very happy with the 5200 and expect to be so for a long time to come.

Strength:
Light, fast, very smooth ride. Climbs like a goat & goes like a bat down the other side. Love STI shifters; much easier to maintain cadence & don't have to drop a hand to shift. Shifts smoothly & corrrectly, haven't had to fuss with adjustments. Good wet braking.
Good wheelset, still as true as day one


Weakness:
Stickers! They want you to know it's a Trek. It could be a little more understated; it's a nice looking bike except for the hard sell.
The jury is still out on the seat. I can still only make peace with it for about an hour. I'm not certain what is a reasonable expectation; I understand it's not a sofa.
My rear tire is scrubbing away pretty quick, but riding about 90% on chip seal that's to be expected.
Shifters rattle a little on chip seal; all is quite on smooth pavement.


Caveat: I spent the previous 25 years on a bike (Pugeot) that now seems like a half track by comparison; I can't make comparisons to other modern machines.
That said I absolutely love this bike. I knocked several minutes off my previous times the first day out on a 90 minute round. It did seem a bit squirrely at speed at first (in the rain, natch) but that vanished within a couple of days as my sense of balance & handling adjusted.
Everything on the bike has stayed true, tight, and in adjustment for the first 600 miles. I am totally happy with my purchase and with the help I got from Greggs in fitting

Weakness:
None so far, other than the fact that there are a lot of Trek's out there - but hey, if it's a good bike, who cares!
Also, the decal stickers are a little cheesy.


I will reiterate what many of the previous reviews have stated. This bike climbs VERY well, as the BB is pretty stiff. The carbon frame is unbelievably forgiving and provides for a very smooth ride. I rode my first century with this bike and was amazed at how comfortable it was.

Weakness:
Would go for Dur ace rather than Ultegra


Having riden a 1400 Trek for the past 2 years I had been thinking seriously about a carbon fibre bike for the past 6 months (hitting 47 and the younger riders going past me on the hills was probably a big motivation). I was unsure of the expence and didn't believe all the talk about a carbon frame from those who spent the money. I thought they have to be saying its worth it when yoy spend that kind of cash.
Anyway I took the plunge after my Trek1400 was damaged on a crash (probably did this sub-consiously) I didn't notice that much difference on the flat but when I got to the Donegal hills, what a difference. I got to the top 3 gears down on what I normally did and went up other hills with ease. On the downhill I had trouble holding the bike back. What a feeling! It's the best purchase I've ever made.

After months of researching and test rides, I finally settled on the 5200. Now that I have about 500 miles on this bike, I feel like I can safely write about it. In a word: awesome. I don't think there's anything new I can say about this bike that hasn't already been said, but I can reiterate. The OCLV120 frame is ultra light, stiff on sprints, climbs like an escalator and provides a very forgiving ride at the same time. Yeah, it's a bike that costs well over $2k, but it's actually pretty amazing what you get for your money. A comparable framset from most other companies is going to run almost the same amount as this complete setup, and then you're just paying for sex appeal. Some reviews state that the OCLV gives a ""dead"" feel, but I don't notice this. I've been riding an all alum frame for a several years and the all carbon is a welcome relief. I can still feel the road, but the road vibration is gone. It did take me about 2 weeks to reach some kind of agreement with the saddle. There were a few times in the first week where I wanted to launch it, but I guess I grew into it.

Strength:
Ride and fit


Weakness:
Bar tape


I am glade I bought the Trek 5200 over the Trek 2300. The roads where I live are tar and chip, very rough, with a lot of hills. The carbon fiber absorbs a lot of the vibration that an aluminum bike has. If you live where the roads are smooth the Trek 2300 would be a great bike for the money.

The carbon fiber bike feels like you are going slower then an aluminum bike. It gives you more security when going down big hills and alows you to go even faster.

I weigh 250pds. I do not feel the bike flex at all. It feels rock solid. The Trek Dealer told me that I cannot break this bike. We shall see. 

The paint job on my bike was perfect. I don't know if I was lucky. Maybe Trek got the hint when everyone was complaining about the paint quality.

I have few complaints with the bike. When I sprint or am doing hills the handle bars squeek. The front wheel was out of true by about 3 millimeters. The bar tape is not working for me. The first time I road the bike the bar tape started sliding and curling. I have had to retape the bars every time I ride. It is the Bontrager non-stick bar tape.

The only thing that I would like to change is the Bar Tape, Seat, and gearing to a 12-27 cog.

-Climbs great
-Full Ultegra
-Bontrager tires are excellent
-45mph!! Never did that on a mountain bike


Weakness:
-Decals too thick

I bought this bike for 2 reasons:
1. To ride 10-20 miles per ride
2. High resale value on ebay

I have had the bike for 3 weeks and have 300 miles on it. I ride it every clear day. My rides have increased to 40 mile Saturday trips and 20 mile after work rides. When I get off the bike, I fell no pains and have no complaints. It does everything I ask it to, and well. I weigh 200 lbs. now, the carbon does its job in smoothing out the rough roads. I live in NY, the roads are beat after this long winter. This is my first road bike, I am originally a mountain biker so making a comparison to another road bike is not possible. After dialing in the proper riding position I was able to ride with the ""B"" group this weekend, I previously rode with the ""C"" group but lead most of the way. This bike wont be for sale on EBAY anytime soon, I love it and it is changing my life.

Strength:
Smooth ride, great wheelset, climbs like a really fast goat, all Ultegra, lightweight, etc.


Weakness:
Stickers


This is my second review on this bike and I can't think of anything I don't like about it. I've put hundreds of miles on it and the wheels are still as true as the day I bought it. The carbon frame really soaks up vibration. I feel a lot less fatigue after a long ride than I did on aluminum. On climbs when I'm riding with others, everybody else seems like they are dying and I'm thinking ""Come on! Let's go""! In the last race I did (100K), I noticed a lot of other Trek carbon bikes at the front of the pack with me. Coincidence? I think not! I had plenty of energy to hammer the last 6 or 7 miles and put a lot of distance between me and everybody in the pack behind me. At the end of that ride, I didn't feel very tired at all. I went and rode a MTB race the next day and felt fine. If I only had one complaint about the bike, it would be the stickers. If you use a trunk rack or one that holds the bike by the frame, it can be rough on the finish. I wrap my bike with pieces of an automotive wash cloth to protect the finish. Other than that, no problems with this bike. It's super smooth and quiet. Really nice!

Strength:
-Weight
-Road dampening

Weakness:
-Some loss of power to drivetrain.
-As so many other people say, at this price point, can't they paint on the logos as opposed to the stickers.


Started cyccling on a 1998 Trek 1200 last year and fell in love with the sport. Bought my 5200 in October just before the end of the season. I have put 500 miles on it in the last month and have no real complaints. The carbon frame is incredibly smooth and the wheelset flies. I went with the Triple Crankset due to the mountains I live near. I take some flack for that, but I just laugh over my shoulder as I pass them all in ""granny low"". The carbon frame is sturdy but not stiff. At 205 lbs, I feel some of the stroke energy is absorbed by the frame and not making it to the drivetrain. The trade off you are making with this bike is less weight and no road vibrations over the raw power of a steel frame. Stock seat stinks. I replaced with a Trek Select Gel seat (my wife is now pregnant thanks to that seat). For this price, you'd be hard pressed to find a better overall bike (although the Lemond carbon steel bikes look interesting).

I decided to go with the Trek 5200 over some other models that had ultegra components and were $1,000 cheaper (and aluminum). I've been riding it nearly every day since I bought it in January. The carbon frame makes riding very enjoyable and smooth. The components are light enough for me and work very well. I got the Trek because I didn't want to have to pay another 2grand next year once I start racing more to upgrade my frame etc. The only downside to the stock bike is the saddle. The components are great, but they might not work for some professionals and experienced riders who are picky.

Strength:
Frame rigidity- the bike is stiff enough to handle well, but still soaks in the road slap. 
Wheelset- The Bontrager Race Lite wheels are light and strong. They can take daily abuse and are ready to roll on race day.
Full Ultegra- enough said.
Seat Post- bontrager Race Lite Carbon Seat post with easily adjustable clamp.


Weakness:
Decals- the bike is littered with decals from Trek and Bontrager, many of which can not be removed.
Saddle- the San Marco saddle is designed for the heavier rider. With out the weight on your side the saddle seems very rounded and did not allow me to catch my seat bones well.
Oversized Handlebar Clamp- the bars get very wide as the approach the stem, thus noticable when changing hand positions.
There everywhere- but that is what happens when you have a solid ride for a good price.


I really wanted the Specialized Allez, but that bike did not fit me well. The Trek 5200, using slightly smaller frame geometry than many and their Horizontal Top Tube, fits increadibly well. The bike accelerates with easy, climbs beautifully, and handles agressively in the turns. 58cm frame w/o pedals weighs 17.25 pounds making this bike an increadible steal for a stock bike. Couple this with great components, availability to test ride in many shops, a solid wheel set, and a major manufacturer to back their product it has allowed this bike to be seen every where. Fortunately, the USPS logos have been removed for the 04 model, but the Team Blue frame still resembles some of the earlier frame designs.

i buy a new bike every year, either a road or mtb as i tend to be very hard on my equipment. my previous bike was about the same equipment level but a taiwanese alu frames with carbon fork to save money. the difference in the ride quality is more than you could imagine. the bike allows me to attack later in rides as i am not fatigued from road vibration.

i thought at the time i was ordering the bike that i was paying quite alot for it, i was wrong. if you buy a bike from taiwan you usually get machine built wheels that i end up having to replace as they will not stay true with me. add the cost of a decent wheelset and all the other small parts that companies cheep out on to a taiwanese bike and the trek is actually an excellent value

Strength:
Smooth ride.
Stability in high speed.
Fun to ride!


Weakness:
Comes without pedals needed to add pedals.
You really need bicycle pants with this seat!
Cannot take to the city, no lock will stand the thieves. I'll use it only for my exercise around the house will never leave them outside locked always inside!!!
I will keep my hybrid for the nice rides to the North End in Boston... I know I will see them after locking them.


I had an hybrid trek 7200 that I rode on bike trails in the weekend.
I wanted bikes that I can ride on the roads with extra speed. Stared to look at various trek bikes. I tried this just for the fun, never really meant to buy it. It is so much better than other treks like trek 1000. I remember the smile on my face when I was going up the hill and specially down the hill. I decided that if I am getting a road bike this is it. 
I rode my new bikes once, I bought a map that marks rodes around my home that are suitable for road bikes and planned aroute for 12 miles. The ride was so smooth the bikes are so resposive. I have the CATEYE audometer that shows cadence as well as speed. I felt very safe with these bikes since they are so responsive. In the same energy that my 7200 rode 13 mph with these bike I was doing 19mh. I could go well above 20mph and the bike still felt very stable. I am overweight (222 pounds for 5,7 person). This ride is sure worth the money I hope to loose more weight using these bikes. I also have the cycleopps indoor trainer I have used the bikes with that. It is much more silent than using the hybrid. 

Conclusion
-----------
This bikes is great!!!
It is everything I expected from plus my wife doesn't complain when I use it with my indoor trainer.

Strength:
Smoothness of ride. Very good value for the money.


Weakness:
The choice of colors and decals on the stock bike is not very appealing. Using Project One to just get additional paint schemes was too pricey for me.


My first impression is very, very favorable. I have not even put 100 miles on it but I know it is a keeper. I would agree with another poster that the most outstanding quality is the smoothness of the ride. I still feel the road and the bumps but they don't knock me off the saddle like my aluminum bike tended to do. I was able to drop overall bike weight with the 5200 from my previous bike and I can tell the difference on the hills. I can feel the bike accelerate when I push on the pedals as opposed to just keeping pace. I upgraded the shifters to DuraAce and the other Ultegra components work as smooth as butter.

SMOOTH, SMOOTH, SMOOTH!!! some people say it feels like riding on wood...while the feedback from the bike to my body is different than an aluminum or titanium frame. I really enjoy the smooth ride than my butt and my body getting beat to heck!


Weakness:
Decals only thing I can see and they really are not that bad.


This bike is incredible!! I test road a number of different bikes, Giants, Specailized, Cannondale, Lightspeeds, etc. I was ready to purchase a lightspeed when I happened to see a Trek dealer in town so I stopped in a test rode a 5200....ordered one on the spot! The difference in ride was amazing. Stiff and responsive yet incredibly smooth. Everyone of my friends that take it for a ride love it. It is like riding on air it is so silky smooth. The frame looks great except that I do wish the decals looked nicer. The ultragra components work flawlessly. All in all a phenomenal bike. I liked it so much that after about a month I went in and ordered a MAdone to replace it. I figured if the 5200 is this great than the Madone will be out of this world. I will write a review of that when I get it in.

Light, good value for price


Weakness:
overall quality, paint, dropouts, finish,etc...


I write this review torn about this bike. My current bike is great but it took alot to get it this way. My first frame had problems with the rear dropouts, the second frame I recieved also had dropout problems causing the wheel to sit too deep in the frame. The third frame was alright but the paint quality I feel is not up to par with what they used to be. The bike rides nice, is light and for what you get iss good for the price, however I would say that my confidence in this frame is just not there. Maybe trek is pumping so many out that their quality is slipping. I disagree with last reviewer that the Italian bikes are overpriced. One of them will be my next choice, Maybe colnago?

Strength:
Lightweight, very responsive, comfortable, beautiful, and you can't get a better bike for the price!


Weakness:
NONE


I have been out of road racing for about 10 years and been doing a lot of mountain bike racing. My last road bike was an aluminum bike about $300. I seriously must have read every single review on this site looking for the perfect bike under $3,000. I test rode a lot of bikes locally and probably drove all the bike shops crazy. The 5200 is an incredible bike. All of the reviews for the 2003 model are right. This bike rides super smooth. Absorbs a lot of vibration. It doesn't make a sound on the road. It's super light too. Don't let the fact that it's a big name bike scare you away. This bike is awesome and I guarantee you would be happier with this bike than some italian bike costing twice as much. I have had several Trek bikes and race on a Trek 8000 in MTB races. Trek is a great bike company. Also, you can look at the 5200 on Trek's website, but it doesn't do it justice. When you see it in person, it is beautiful! When you ride it, you'll be sold. There is virtually no power loss when you mash on the pedals. It climbs great as well. I don't have a lot of miles on it yet, but I'll write another review after I've logged a couple thousand miles. I'm sure it will be all 5's as well.

If you decide to start racing, you might aim for something a little lighter, but if you're a serious rider and just having fun, this is a great bike.


The Trek 1200 is a sweet bike for anybody getting into road biking. The components aren't top of the line, but don't suck either. If you decide to get serious, you can always upgrade these, but the frame is solid. The wheels on mine were bomb-proof, and the only thing I upgraded was the pedals.  I put 4,500 miles on mine before getting t-boned by a drunk driver who ran a red light. I was lucky to walk way from the accident, but my bike was not.

Frame, forks, wheel sets that can take a pounding on curb cuts and stay tight and true, geometry, quality of fabrication, the components aren't top of the line but they are very reliable.


Weakness:
The only draw back is the Tiagra front derailer. It requires a bit of attention to maintain adjustment, but they had to cut corners somewhere to offer it at such a low price.


I purchased the Trek 1200 because it has the frame and carbon fork of a more expensive road bike. The wheels sets and the derailers aren't the top of the line, but they are solid. In the real World, spending the bucks on lighter wheels with less spokes or aero spokes doesn't make as much of as your choice of tires: I ride on 700X23's at 140 psi and with this set up, I dog on bikes costing many times more. My usual ride is a 30 mile loop that I can do in 1 hour and 15 minutes flat.

Strength:
Light, Comfortable, Efficient


Weakness:
1. Front Derailleur may need periodic adjustment. 2. The 1990 models used allen wrench bolts to hold the seat, which makes real time adjustments impossible without tools.


I bought my Trek 1200 used, about 15 years ago. I guess it is about a 1991 model, based upon color scheme. It had enhanced by its previous owner with Phil Wood hubs and a rear 7 gear drive with a 6 gear shift assembly. After a couple of years, I got married. There it sat until 2007. I pulled it down and with a little lubrication, new rubber, a replaced front derailleur cable with associated adjustment, and some minor tweaking to the rear shifter/derailleur and voila! This bike is a joy to ride.  I switched wheels. I had some great 700x25 wheels of a no-name Centurian that beat anything else I have ever owned. The Centurian wheels put a 6 gear rear hub so that now the shifter/derailleur work in virtually perfect harmony.  My wife and I are preparing for a Quarter Tri in the spring and a Half Tri in the fall. It rides as well at ~16 years old as her new Trek does today.  The bike is a smooth as silk once it got tuned up. Assuming the newer models are at least as good as the 1990 models, a typical entrance level Tri-Athelete would find this bike totally acceptable.

Strength:
the frame is rigid and the straight carbon fork is a charm for a rigid ride and does not flex under my 150+ pounds(which i have found common among curved carbon forks).


Weakness:
the seat is very hurtful,and the position can be a drag,but in the end it saves my knees which will come in handy later in my life.


i had had my bike for only two weeks and find it a little difficult to adjust to the new position.especially since i am used to using heavy gears and the smaller fit and more forward seat angle(even though i pushed d seat all the way back) is simply not very comfortable for heavy gears.the front derailliur needs a little adjusting during rides but is manegeable.it is speedy and thanks to its rigidity accelerates rather quickly even though i just naturally cant accelerate quickly.

Strength:
Lightweight for the priceWill last FOREVERLow maintinence bikeGood for beginners-intermediatesAll components work beautifully


Weakness:
As with every bike, the chain has to be replaced every 1500-2000 miles.. otherwise say goodbye to your cassette. The wheels could be lighter, but i'm not complaining. Stock tires don't last more than 700 miles or so.


I've put about 8000 miles on this bike by completing 2 pacific-atlantic coast rides, both clocking in at about 3300 miles. I've toured with it, i've taken it on endless gravel roads, i've raced with it, taken it down hills exceeding 55mph (with 50 pounds of gear on the back).. everything you can think of, and have essentially never had a problem with it. Essentially meaning other than normal maitinence. I decided last minute to take it in a track race. I was flying past pro's with $6,000+ bikes (im only 19 and am new to racing) and was smoking everyone on this amazing machine. As deciding to race last minute, I didn't have enough time to swap my mountain bike pedals that were on it. It caught asphalt around a corner at 30mph, destroying me, but the bike is still strong. The wheels need a little truing, and i need new griptape, but the bike (having suffered a similar crash 3 years ago), is still perfect!

I've got 4200 miles on it and have only replaced the chain. Many have complained about the FD. I have not had any problem after the first (and only) adjustment I made a few weeks after I started riding it. I have to admin however, that even with Atlanta's hills, I rarely drop to the granny ring.

Strength:
This bike was custom fit and tuned by my brother who used to run a shop so I have zero issue with fit or mechanicals. At the end of each road ride I always state I need to go out more often during the week for the fun factor - makes you forget you're actually ""exercising"".... If (or when) parts wear out, I'll replace them with higher end spec.


Weakness:
None so far. People have complained about the shifting (no issue - don't cross gear it) and the seat (fine for me - requires some saddle time to get used to sitting on a saddle again after the winter when logging some mileage).


As a mtn biking convert I always frowned on roadies in the past but thanks to Lance and Floyd, found myself wanting to give the road a whirl. I'm sorry I waited so long to do so as road riding is fantastic and this bike is simply great! Keep in mind that it IS my FIRST road bike so anything lighter than a Santa Cruz Heckler with 2.7 knobbies on the road is going to get major bonus points in my mind! That said, this thing pegs the meter as it flat out flies on the open road. Handles real nice. Carbon fork and seatpost are nice touches. Great bike for the $$$.

This is my first performance road bike.

Bike purchased 54cm. my height 5ft 8"". Otherwise seat very comfortable. seem to lose the chain on the FD nearly every time I take it out, LBS unable to help here either. Maybe need to upgrade to 105. Think that the badge costs as better deals out with higher spec for same money. Otherwise nice bike. No regrets.

Not as fancy as my usual crews' bikes, but works well for me. I had to switch out the FD to 105, which was an improvement on the Tiagra. Also upgraded the cassette to Ultegra. SPD pedals.

Price, durabilty, and quality of carbon fiber, frame and components.


Weakness:
Front Derailleur


I bought this bike back in May and used it throughout the summer and fall and will have to say that I absolutely love it. Now before I go on, I should say that this is the first road bike that I have owned. Anyway, for the money I don't think that you could find a better bike. The components are great though, the front derailleur can be a little slow in shifting (it is a Tiagra) but the rear is quick and precise(Shimano 105). The carbon fiber fork, stem, and seat post are great and the rims seem to be really durable. Where I live, a nice, smooth rode is a rarity and after all of the miles I have rode this year they are still just like new. I did switch the rear tire to a Bontrager Race Lite Hardcase mostly due to the road conditions and also for peace of mind out on some of my long rides. To me the saddle is wonderful. I know that many people have a complaint with it, but even when I first started to ride it, I could go out riding, even without cycling shorts, and still be comfortable. Overall, the Trek 1200 is a great bike and definately worth the price.

Pretty good road bike for the price, I was mainly a mountain biker but wanted to get into more road riding and got a great deal on an '05 model. Like other posts, the FD is a bit inconsistent at times but I plan on an upgrade in the near future. For a vast improvement on an already capable bike upgrade the wheelset - HUGE difference, my avg speed increased, my acceleration increased, hills became even more fun!

Weakness:

This review is for the 2006 model. This is my first road bike, so my review is a bit naive, I'm sure. The bike is fast, responsive, and good looking. The shop actually had to swap out the first one I purchased because of a flaw in the frame, which threw off the FD. The new bike works great, although I must echo the many complaints about the FD. I've dropped the chain a couple times while shifting to the granny gear. I'm going to ask the shop about getting a 105 or Ultegra.  The wheelset on the bike is the bontrager select, which is the set on the 1500. Not sure how they got on the 1200, but I'm not complaining. It's a nice bike, and it's made my decision to get on the road and share my time with my XC bike a good one.

Weakness:
Tiagra FD is horrible - needed adjustments after only 50 miles


As a new rider, I found this model excelent for my needs. The only glaring problem has been the front DR (Tiagra), which needed adjustments after only 50 miles. I replaced it with an Ultegra, which is a vast improvement.  Like the poster below, I also had problems with the chain slipping off in the granny gear with the Tiagra. So far the Ultegra hasn't had that problem. Although I love this bike, I wish I'd spent the extra $$$ for the 1500, which has better components overall.

Strength:
Great looking bike. Climbs hills with ease, and flies down them...almost too fast for me at this point (I probably need a better helmet).


Weakness:
Chain slips off the front gear when I don't shift properly.


Just bought the 2006 model. I'm a complete newbie, so take this for what its worth. I love this bike so far, although my only comparisons are based on test riding a few in a similar price range. My only complaint is that I have managed to pop the chain off several times when getting sloppy with my shifting (which I'm hoping will improve as my riding skills improve). Seems that when I shift all the way down into the ""granny gear"" on the front and the bike's not ready for it the chain slips right off. I guess if I wasn't so random with my shifting this wouldn't be a problem, but it seems like the bike should be able to handle it without dropping the chain. Other than that I love it, and cannot wait to improve my riding skills so I can hang with some intermediate groups.

Weakness:
Weight kinda, Slowish Shifting from the 105 RD, Wheelset is generic, Tiagra triple FD is horrid, though that might be jsut cuz it's a triple...


I noticed a predominant trend in many of the reviews, of complaints of the saddle being hard. I would agree, when I first got the bike, I was transitioning from a soft MTB saddle, and yes, the saddle killed me. I worked up from 10 mile rides up to 50 mile rides over the period of about 2 months, and by that point I developed a tolerance to the saddle - you grow to conform to it, and also, it does in fact seem to get softer where most of your weight is (wherever your sit bones are usually), and as such become more comfortable: initially I could not ride more than 15 miles w/o padded shorts, now I'm comfortable doing 80 miles without bike shorts. Though it's a rare occurence that I ride without shorts, since most of my rides are training rides (12 hours of training a week, usually about 240, 250 mi/wk).The saddle becomes VERY nice and comfortable, just up till it's comfortable, you'll not like it. At all. But, once it's broken in, it is second to none; I put an SLR on my bike for 2 months and disliked it compared to the ""cheap"" or whatnot 'trager saddle, and found I actually liked the original more.This bike is very good for someone interested in getting into riding. If you are considering getting into racing, I would recommend going for the 1500 isntead of the 1200, as it will lose something in the area of 4 pounds (My bike; 23.5, my friend's 19.5).However, if you aren't interested in racing, or only intend to do it a bit, this is a very good bike; it wont hold you back too much; 4 pounds is about 2 kilos, which means you'll be working 2.5% harder than a rider on a 1500. Not really a big difference, and a very hard to notice one.This bike is very good at climbing; I climbed Mt Pisgah in an hour and a half, according to Liberty Bikes, it takes an average racer 1:45:00 to climb it, and I'm 15 so the bike clearly isnt holding you back.

Light frame - Shimano 105 rear gear - Handling skills


Weakness:
Position is a bit too aggressive. Front gear is not so good (Tiagra)


A wonderful bike well fitted to climb the Pyrenees passes. First time I bike a road bike : until recently I had a Giant mtn bike which I used to cross France and Switzerland on week-long tours. Given that I could even climb some passes of the Tour de France (Ventoux, Col de l'Izoard, Galibier, etc...) with that heavy machine, I now believe that I could now fly to the moon with my Trek 1200 rocket. Now real life on the pyrenean and alpin roads begins! Although I find the position a bit too bent over the handlebars, this bike is incredibly easy to handle. It's light and reactive, even though the standard version comes with (too?) modest wheels. In a nutshell, a great bike for a recreational climber whose pleasure increases with suffering on the seat!

good price/value. has some decent shimano parts on it (not better than my campy parts tho =) .. also rides well.. always though road bikes were uncofortable until now! Nice upgrade with the carbon post/fork, helps! Definaly worth it!


Weakness:
tyrs wear too fast, front derailuer sucks. hubs not very fast (or as fast as they should be) also wheels pull whay too much in cross wind. the new eurus cut right though it!

and doesnt come with clipless pedals


Well.. I acually have the 2006 model. I would have to say overall an awsome bike. Never complained on how much I rode that baby. This was my first road bike and ill tell you what. It definalty is fast. It just wants to take off. Sense of speed is great! I have a total of about 700 miles. At about the 150 mile marker, blew a tyre. probably because of where I was riding. At about the 500 mile marker. One of the links in the chain craped out on me. Although, not a big deal, but just wanted to mention it. And one notiable difference in the front wheel. After the first 500 miles. was starting to come out of true. although i have now swapped it out with my new eurus. Shifting never seemed to be hard except the front deraulier. And i never seemed to use the whole triple. also, that seat is brutal when you first start riding. I have broken it in pretty good. but you will definaly need the bike shorts (which i have, and helped).

I must say, it was definatly worth the investment. If i could do it again, i would without hesitation. I have had the bike for about 1 and 1/2 months now. and loving every minute. Expecially because I just put on 2005 campy record groupset. which makes a world of difference!

Also, tyres seem to wear pretty fast. rear wheel had a notiable flat spot around the whole tyre, after about 200 miles.

This is my first roadbike, and I love it compared to my mtn bike. It is FAST! I feel like a few strokes of the pedals and I'm flying. I have officially converted. This is a great bike, I find it quite comfortable, after the seat is broken in (or is that my ass that is broken in?). the 105 rear is nice, but I've had problems with consisitant shifting with the tiagras up front, which is soon to go the way of the Dodo. I'm a big guy (6'0"", 210), but feel very comfortable riding and stopping this bike. Definitely worth the extra cash over a 1000. Overall, a great bike for the money, backed by the rock-soid customer support from foothill cyclery.

I got started into racing and relized it wasen't the entirly correct bike but yeah i didn't know about racing previously. The stem is at way to high of an angle i feel like i am on a comfort bike. The seat is hard but a set of bike shorts fixes that until you can upgrade if you want. I love this bike, everything is awesome don't need to put any money into it unless you ride competitivly. Much better than the 1000, definatly worth the extra cash. So i would recomend this bike very highly.

Really great bike, I was considering the Trek 1000 but my dealer suggested it would be well worth my money to spend the extra cash and get the 1200.

I've put over 100 miles on this so far and I have to say I love it. Coming from a Mtn Bike on the road, this thing flat out rocks. After some adjustment on the seat and pedals, the bike is really comfy and actually has a nice ride. I don't have any other road bike experience but man this thing is fast. It seems like it always wants to accelerate and go faster. It also turns really fast...something I had to get used to. Carbon fork and seat post are nice touches. And so far the wheels seem to be pretty strong for my 205 lbs. Front deraileur is a bit finicky as the chain has popped off a bunch of times although I think that it just needs to be serviced. Overall a great bike and I'm very happy with it!

not much, seat could be switched for preference, no clipless pedals, weight (but not a huge issue unless you're an elite racer, but then you wouldn't want this bike anyway.)


What can I say about this bike, I love it!!! I have been so pleased with my Trek that I want to eventually get a mountain bike by the company too. I am a former college runner and have switched to cycling to save my knees. The biggest asset to this bike is the Trek quality. I am fairly light, so climbing is a little easier for me, but this bike climbs better than its 750 dollar price tag. The ride is fairly smooth, and I have ridden some pretty hilly, bumpy, potholed roads around here and not had any problems. Only problem was not the bike's fault. Wrecked in my first road race and bent the stock wheelset (by the way, a helmet kept me from scraping my scalp off). Got a cheap set of Ebay and they just arn't the same. Other than that, they should also come with clipless pedals, but that was an easy upgrade. Over all, great bike for serious new road riders. 2005 models likely better, the new 1000 from Trek seems to be anyway.

Also the seat was very uncomfortable and the stem was a poor design for the geometry of this bike. These are the only problems that i ecountered with this bike.

Weakness:
the superlight aluminium not really superlight; I dont minde that actually, bacause I feel the bike under myself and feel how stiff it is. It is not a drawback, I think.


I have been riding this bike for about 6 months. Being a triathlete I would say this machine does a really great job for me. Very good for sprints, also climbs quite well, but not too convinient: the seat is pretty hard, the frame and the seat together pick up all the bumps which is not very advantageous for long rides. To tell the truth the bike is my first aluminium framed bike, however so far I am very happy with it.
