Trek1500,only the disposable items  saddle  pedals  tires  though the tires are suprisingly good for stock tires and particularly for bontrager  i looked at options for months  did bids on ebay  asked the experts and all  and my conclusion is that if you already have a mountain bike there s no use buying a cyclocross bike to go roadie on  you just don t need it  get a road bike  and i recommend this one very highly for anyone else who wants to add to their cycling repetoire  this bike can take on the kinds of rough road conditions we have in new york city  no problem  and serves up a nice balance between agile and stable so you can tackle tough  short rides or use it to tour or century on  the carbon fork and post are enough to dampen a rough ride to a degree that s comparable with a cro moly frame  the ultimate in comfort next to carbon  it makes me wonder why roadies are so squeemish about all but smooth  highway grade road  but maybe this bike is exceptionally stable  really rough stuff at high speed is something to be cautious of on this bike  but for the most part you shouldn t have a problem  i also have had no problems with the bike occilating at high speed despite being  a big guy  which a lot of bikes of this quality are prone to do with heavy riders  i m not a clydesdale  but i m not     lbs either note that george hincapie is     lbs  so no worries if you re topping     or and change unless you re really up there at     and not planning to drop    anytime soon   as far as riding this versus the mountain bike  the only real adjustments i ve had to make are  no camelbak  leaned too far over  and it s just  un roadie like    i loosened the stem and tilted the handlebar up so i could more comfortably ride with my hands on the hoods and effectively work the brakes  and of course i changed the saddle height and angle to preference  the difference in braking is the only significant adjustment  after the first long ride i could barely use my hands anymore because i was squeezing the brakes in a way that i don t have to on the mountain bike  even a couple of months later  i m still developing those braking muscles  but at least i can use the brakes now after several hours of riding  you might want to ease into road riding just for that reason alone  and of course it s a hell of a lot faster and easier to go than a mountain bike  the mountain bike simply doesn t move by comparison  at some point i actually felt the road bike was too easy  like i barely had to pedal  but then i just changed where and how i ride  if i were touring  this would be a breeze to ride in comparison to the tougher work on the mountain bike  and no less comfortable as far as i m concerned similar products used this is my first true road bike  i have a trek      mountain bike as well  it s nice having both ,disposable items saddle pedals tires though tires suprisingly good stock tires particularly bontrager looked options months bids ebay asked experts conclusion already mountain bike use buying cyclocross bike roadie need get road bike recommend one highly anyone else wants add cycling repetoire bike take kinds rough road conditions new york city problem serves nice balance agile stable tackle tough short rides use tour century carbon fork post enough dampen rough ride degree comparable cro moly frame ultimate comfort next carbon makes wonder roadies squeemish smooth highway grade road maybe bike exceptionally stable really rough stuff high speed something cautious bike part problem also problems bike occilating high speed despite big guy lot bikes quality prone heavy riders clydesdale lbs either note george hincapie lbs worries topping change unless really planning drop anytime soon far riding versus mountain bike real adjustments make camelbak leaned far roadie like loosened stem tilted handlebar could comfortably ride hands hoods effectively work brakes course changed saddle height angle preference difference braking significant adjustment first long ride could barely use hands anymore squeezing brakes way mountain bike even couple months later still developing braking muscles least use brakes several hours riding might want ease road riding reason alone course hell lot faster easier mountain bike mountain bike simply move comparison point actually felt road bike easy like barely pedal changed ride touring would breeze ride comparison tougher work mountain bike less comfortable far concerned similar products used first true road bike trek mountain bike well nice,0.078,0.754,0.169,0.0967741935483871,0.0483870967741935,0.0967741935483871,0.0161290322580645,"['bike', 'mountain', 'road', 'ride', 'tires', 'rough', 'riding', 'brakes', 'high', 'speed']"

Trek1000, poor dealer setup  too loose  not enough loctite  tires are garbage  no puncture reistantce at all  very thin  stock brake pads eat up the rims really fast  embeded aluminum filings wear down the rim in no time    no clear coat bought it one month old off craig s list  i think the previous owner scratched the rear derailleur and couldn t return it  hence sold it   i ve probably put about       km in the   months that i ve had it  usually do a     km ride on nice days  commute about    km one way  i rode it through all the snow storms this past winter  a few showers  and it s still going  having nothing to rust beats most most department store and used bikes you see people riding around on down town  i ve had a several light crashes on this bike  it s held up quite well  only bar tape and britfer scratches that are hardly noticeable  paint job gets looks from people with bike five times the price  bike looks nice from some angles  the effect on the paint makes it look nicer than it really is  would be nicer with a clear coat so it doesn t show wear  the derailleur system is what it is  the cables do stretch and cause the system to be off after a month  if it s dialed in  it works quite well  the front derailleur is not the best  but works well if you have it dialed in  keep it clean as the wheels kick alot of dirt on it  here s the big tip alot of owners seem to be missing  when up shifting the front d railleur  push and hold the shifter all the way in until the d railleur has engaged the chain  this will push the d railleur a bit further than just the click point  allowing the chain to engage more easily  make sure your limit screw is not set to tight as this will also make it hard to get into the high gear  and stop you from using the tip  also be sure to use the down tube cable tensioners to correct for cable stretch every month or so  when down shifting onto the granny gear  you can push the shifter in to wear you begin to feel the resistance of the first click  this is basically wear the brifter begin to take up cable slack  hold and push the button  now slowly release the shifter  the derailleur doesn t jerk as much and won t drop the chain  similar to previously mentioned tip above  lube the plastic guide plate under your bottom bracket and keep your front derailleur clean for better shifting  that cable guide is what causes most of the resistance and roughness you feel when upshifting  put grease underneath the cables  and then clean any exposed grease to stop dirt   the the metal around the o ring  on the cable adjustment on the front brakes  can hit and cause a scratch on your frame if you let the handle bar swing all the way to the right  i suspect part of the performance issues might be due to the fact that trek ships this bike with longer than optimal cable housings  consider trimming them according to the guide sheldon brown has posted on his website  and ensure the cables are lubed properly  ensure you have both sets of water bottle screws installed  mine doesn t have the ones on the downtube  allowing water entry into the frame  the frame is completely sealed otherwise  except for the holes on the back of the chain stays  i ve put quite a bit of wear and tear on the rear d railleur and right shifter  i shift fairly often due to traffic and lights and down shift every time i stop yet wear is not noticeable  i lubricate the derailleur with only and the swivel joints and it keeps it running smoothly  i ve have had an issue with the plastic shifter handles loosening from the metal part its screwed into  which causes the shifters to rattle  and be loose back and forth when not holding the breaks  and rub against the plastic underneath  a little loctite and pushing the shifter all the way in to screw it in resolves that  i ve had my right pedal loose the dust cap and the strap break a month and a half ago  and it s still going  consider getting clipless pedals and an updrage to the      or shimano      if your going to ride seriously   i suspect the reason most other owners have had problems is due to same reason i have  simple maintenance neglect  keept it lubed  clean  and well adjusted and your trek      will run great similar products used      trek     ,poor dealer setup loose enough loctite tires garbage puncture reistantce thin stock brake pads

Madone6_9,  cost  yes  a con too   even though reasonable compared to other high end carbon frames  it is still a lot  and still out of the range of the normal cyclist   stock color pallete  i know  picky  but the stock colors were ugly  part of why i got a project   so i could pick my own colors   some  suspect  part choices if you get a stock one  high end bontrager wheels and componets are great  some lower end stuff not as much  especially mis tensioned machine built base wheels  also bontrager r  tires wear very fast   and this is compared to vittoria open cx clinchers   in other words  it is hard to find a conwow  simply wowso i have waited till i rode about      miles on the bike  including a     mile    day ride to write a review  a little about my riding  i dont get out of the saddle often  i sit  spin  and hammer  try to keep a       cadence in any gear  and always push hard  when on big climbs  think crawford notch  nh   i wont get out of the saddle till the steep parts  and if i get under    mph  i am relatively smooth  but do push the pedals hard  my   series  project one  with a blue and white argyle paint job   came in a bittersweet way  my   series project one madone was stolen  i loved the   series  it was a good fit  light  responsive  and all livestrong colors  with that being said  the   series blows away the   series in every single way  stability   and this is in someway effected by component choice  i know   but the   series  downhill fast  in pacelines  feels so much more solid and stable      mph descents with aero wheels  even with cross winds i did not feel twitchy  with the   series  over    mph  sometimes it felt twitchy  loose  and even scary  i would check the bike for a loose headset  or loose wheel bearings  because it did not feel stable  but it was just the bike the   series improves on this in every way  rock solid through everything i threw at it comfort   yes  it is carbon  but it does not seem to beat you up  i am not a small rider                 pounds   and the ride is comfortable  the   series almost seemed to stiff  where the   series is just smoother  with almost identical build kits  comparing long rides  i was less fatigued on the new one  the big ride i do is a     mile    day tour around new england  with huge climbs  through mountain passes  and along flats   strength    and i say this versus stability   it never feels wavey when hammering or climbing  like i said  i am not that small  where at times the   series felt broken  i would check for cranks in the bottom bracket  stays  etc  since it seemed to be wishy washy   technical term  haha   the   series is always solid   it somehow manages to be stiff  strong  light  and comfortable overall  it is just a great bike  i got the h  geometry on this one  my last one was h    so it is a  little  more upright  countered by a negative rise stem with no spacers   i dont race anymore  and in my opinion  only racers should get the h   it is aggressive  dont be a hero  be comfortable  it just feels like i never have to worry about anything on the bike  it is strong  all around great  and i am not worried about damaging it  hurting it  or changing my riding style at all  the last thing  the integration of computer functions with the node computer is great  the wireless sensor is built into the chainstay  and put a magnet on your

Madone5_9,i guess i would say the price  but i am very much of the school that you get what you pay for  i guess if i had waited a while i could have gotten a madone cheaper than i did but my shop did alot of extra things for me too  i honestly cant find any weakness with it yet  it is eveything my trek      was and more  also being its a hot bike expect to wait in line for one like i did and alot of other people have  but i would recommend that you get your shop to push them for a date and hold them to it  not because trek is a bad company that way but because if your not on top of things and keep in touch you will miss out  also putting down or paying off the bike to will help you because trek has   differnt list and sold bikes are first priority before i start let me recommend bike authroity in broadview heights ohio out side cleveland  the owner is a super guy and really bent over backwards for me  in      i got a trek      in postal colors  i rode that bike and i was totally amazed that a production american carbon bike could feel so amazing  it was light  stiff in a positive way  responsive  in    years of riding up to that point i had never had such a great bike  being the      was the best bike in treks road line up  when i found out about the madone i was really excited  it wasnt because of the lance craze with them  i thought its a natural prgression up from a       well i was right  this bike is utterly amazing  the shop and i went through hell getting it but oh my it was so worth it  its everything the      was and more  i have ridden some bikes in the past that were scary light and yet they didnt feel stable some how or substantial  in this case the madone is great  i have put on a bit of weight since moving to ohio  so i tend to have bikes built up sturdier now  but i couldnt be happier  its absolutly beautiful  mine doesnt have a usps decal on it but thats fine with me  i really recommend it  it floats on the road  i really feel like in my riding since       ive had probably    bikes in that time  i raced a while to that trek is really on target with a fantastic machine  the new dura ace    is great to  i wanted to say that it has allot of little updates  it fits in your hands better with wht sti levers  i i am so used to it now where  speed shifters just feel cramped compared when i feel them now  there is no chian rub of anykind  even when dura ace   was adjusted perfectly in a sprint it rubbed slightly   the shifting is crisp and positive and quiet  i am also using the deda synapsi carbon bars which  i know  are not legal for racing but oh god the carbon bar and stem set up on a carbon bike just further enhaces the feel  not to mention a look ergo post which is carbon with   times the adjustment of a typical post  the new shimano road pedals are like a time look hybrid  the front part of the cleat is like time and the back part is like look  i think they blow away the spd r pedals  and to finish it off the selle italia pro link saddle is the shape of the old regal saddle but is so much nicer  it is not the lightest to be sure but i have finally found a saddle that doesnt hurt and it really is about anatomy  the more you have in the backside  cough  the wider it should be and more padding i think they are great  i personally think its pretty silly to look for weight savings in aeres where comfort comes first aka aspide saddles    ouch similar products used trek      year      white with red and blue accents  postal edition    speed dura ace  fantastic bike as i stated above  i couldnt tell so much of a differnce between the      and       yes the      was a bit lighter but aside from that to me personally they felt more or less the same  if i compare the      with the madone its a big big differnce  i dont mind being in debt when its worth it and trust me the madone is  pushing a pretty big gear on the flats is like floating the bike just is great  yeah lance rides it and yeah lance is getting paid to ride them but i have ridden colnago c   s and a few other bikes and for me personally the trek is alot better  i learned with trek that you dont have to have something super exotic and rare to have a great bike   if you look at the exotics now they are follwing trends insted of creating them  and with exotics when something happens with them you are screwed or the turn around time is months  not so with trek  there are other good brands out there sure but i sing treks prasis because they earned respect from me  the madone is a total joy to ride ,guess would say price much school get pay guess waited could gotten madone cheaper shop alot extra things honestly cant find weakness yet eveything trek also hot bike expect wait line one like alot people would recommend get shop push date hold trek bad company way top things keep touch miss also putting paying bike help trek differnt list sold bikes first priority start let recommend bike authroity broadview heights ohio side cleveland

Trek5200,the paint job and stickers are a little rinky dink what a joy this is to ride  upgrading from a trek hybrid  my wife and i started out looking in the       market  because my local trek dealer was great in helping fit a variety of bikes both below and above this price for us both to test ride while the bianchi lemond dealer treated us like we were wasting his time  we both pretty quickly decided on treks  i was pretty close to deciding on the      and she was enamoured of a      when the dealer suggested we at least try riding the       we did so with a lot of scepticism as we are both riding to lose weight and weren t sure that a lightweight cf bike would stand up for us  deb assured us that we couldn t and wouldn t break these bikes and even if we did  her shop and trek would make it right we both were staggered at the difference between the      and the other bikes we had tried  in my wife s case  her favorable impression was increased as the dealer had a wsd in her size for her to try and she really liked the geometry  the short reach levers  and even the women s saddle  bottom line  after a lot of soul searching  we both bought a pair of      s   eat your heart out bianchi dealer  i after three months  we are both still thrilled with them  while i admit to still be much of a novice to bikes of this quality  i m not sure i understand the often stated complaint about cf as being  wooden   to me i have no problem feeling the road  what i don t have to put up with is the road buzz that often comes with aluminum rides  i find the      to much more comfortable than even the      with its suspension fork and seat post  this is especially true on rides over    miles  it was because our hybrid s were so uncomfortable at any distance over    miles that we switched to road bikes in the first place  i would also toot up the handling and climbing abilities of the      but in fairness  my principal point of comparison is to the hybrid  the ultegra drive train is simply great usually when i make a purchase of this size  there is at least some  buyer s regret  when i second guess was it the right thing to do  here there has been none  every time i get on the bike  i am amazed that i own such a great machine  besides the often criticized finish  the only weakness i ve found is that it lacks the bike lust factor of more obscure rides and you have to put up with the assumption from many who have never ridden one that you only bought it bcause of the lance factor  if only those folks would go ride a       there may be other bikes that are as overall great just to ride and some may even be cheaper  in our case  however  when we consider the support we are getting from our lbs including professional fitting along with trek s warranty and reputation we are very  very happy with the      and expect to be so for a long time to come similar products used move up in a big way to this bike from a hybrid  trek        test rode bianchi giro  trek           c              lemond tourmalet,paint job stickers little rinky dink joy ride upgrading trek hybrid wife started looking market local trek dealer great helping fit variety bikes price test ride bianchi lemond dealer treated like wasting time pretty quickly decided treks pretty close deciding enamoured dealer suggested least try riding lot scepticism riding lose weight sure lightweight bike would stand deb assured break bikes even shop trek would make right staggered difference bikes tried wife case favorable impression increased dealer wsd size try really liked geometry short reach levers even women saddle bottom line lot soul searching bought pair eat heart bianchi dealer three months still thrilled admit still much novice bikes quality sure understand often stated complaint wooden problem feeling road put road buzz often comes aluminum rides find much comfortable even suspension fork seat post especially true rides miles hybrid uncomfortable distance miles switched road bikes first place would also toot handling climbing abilities fairness principal point comparison hybrid ultegra drive train simply great usually make purchase size least buyer regret second guess right thing none every time get bike amazed great machine besides often criticized finish weakness found lacks bike lust factor obscure rides put assumption many never ridden one bought bcause lance factor folks would ride may bikes overall great ride may even cheaper case however consider support getting lbs including professional fitting along trek warranty reputation happy expect long time come similar products used move big way bike hybrid trek test rode bianchi giro trek lemond tourmalet,0.073,0.682,0.245,0.0857142857142857,0.0285714285714285,0.0857142857142857,0.0380952380952381,"['trek', 'dealer', 'bikes', 'hybrid', 'great', 'ride', 'bianchi', 'time', 'road', 'bike']"
