# Analyzing-the-reviews-of-Trek-road-bikes-with-NLP-techniques

Streamlit app project forked for debugging purposes.

## Issues

- Some png files are not loaded due to inconsistent file naming scheme.
- During local development, due to use of resource caching, the streamlit app must be restarted after changes of the files.

## ToDo

- [ ] Fix file names of some of the png images
- [ ] Fix the prefixes in `bikes.json` if needed
